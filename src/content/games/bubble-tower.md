### Detailed Game Introduction

Bubble Tower 3D adds an exciting third dimension to the classic bubble shooter formula. In this game, colorful bubbles are stuck to the outside of a rotating cylindrical tower. Your objective is to clear all the bubbles by shooting a new bubble from your cannon at the bottom and matching it with at least two other bubbles of the same color. The ability to rotate the tower adds a layer of strategy, requiring you to find the best angle for every shot to create massive chain reactions and clear the tower.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Rotate and Inspect:** Before every shot, take a moment to rotate the tower left and right. This allows you to see the entire layout of bubbles and plan your moves more effectively. Look for large clusters of the same color or strategic shots that could cause a large section to fall.
2.  **Bank Shots:** Use the walls of the play area to your advantage. Bouncing your bubble off the side walls can help you reach tricky spots or get behind bubbles that are blocking a direct shot.
3.  **Prioritize Foundational Bubbles:** Look for matches that will detach a large group of differently colored bubbles underneath them. When you pop a cluster, any bubbles that are only connected to that cluster will also fall, clearing the board much faster.
4.  **Use Special Bubbles:** Pay attention to special bubbles like Fireballs or Bombs. These powerful tools can destroy any bubble, regardless of color, and are best saved for situations where you are stuck or need to clear a critical section to prevent losing.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I win the game?**
    *   **A:** You win by clearing all the bubbles from the tower.

*   **Q: What happens if I don't clear the bubbles in time?**
    *   **A:** The tower of bubbles will slowly descend. If any bubble crosses the line at the bottom of the screen, the game is over.

*   **Q: I can't find a match for the bubble in my cannon. What should I do?**
    *   **A:** First, rotate the tower completely to make sure you haven't missed a potential match. If there are truly no matches, you will have to make a tactical shot, placing the bubble in a location where it will cause the least trouble or hopefully set up a future match.
