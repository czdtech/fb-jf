*Bejeweled* is a legendary tile-matching puzzle video game. The objective is to swap two adjacent gems to form a horizontal or vertical line of three or more gems of the same color. When a match is made, the gems disappear, and new gems fall from the top to fill the empty spaces, potentially creating chain reactions called cascades. Its simple yet highly addictive gameplay loop made it a pioneer of the "match-three" genre and one of the most successful casual games of all time. 

### How to Play Bejeweled Game

-  **The Core Action:** The only action you can take is swapping two adjacent gems, either horizontally or vertically. A swap is only valid if it results in at least one match of three or more gems.
-  **Basic Matching:** The primary goal is to create lines of three identical gems. These gems are then cleared from the board, and you earn points.
**Special Gems:** Creating matches of more than three gems creates powerful special gems. These are key to getting high scores: 
- **Flame Gem:** Created by matching four gems in a row. When this gem is matched, it explodes, destroying the eight gems surrounding it.
- **Hyper Cube:** Created by matching five gems in a row. Swap this gem with any adjacent gem, and it will destroy all gems of that color on the board.
- **Star Gem / Lightning Gem:** Created by matching gems in an "L" or "T" shape (in later versions). When matched, it destroys its entire row and column.

**Game Modes:** Bejeweled games typically feature several modes. The most common are: 
- **Classic Mode:** An untimed mode where you play until there are no more possible moves left on the board.
- **Action/Blitz Mode:** A fast-paced, timed mode (often 60 seconds) where the goal is to score as many points as possible before time runs out.



### Strategy and Tips

-  **Look for Bigger Matches:** Don't just settle for matches of three. Actively scan the board for opportunities to create matches of four or five to generate powerful special gems.
-  **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches near the bottom of the board is generally a good strategy. This causes more gems to shift from the top, increasing the chances of creating automatic chain reactions (cascades).
-  **Use Special Gems Wisely:** Don't use a special gem on the first opportunity. Save Hyper Cubes for a moment when the board is filled with a specific color, or use Flame Gems to clear out difficult-to-reach areas.
-  **Don't Rush (in Classic Mode):** In untimed modes, take your time to analyze the entire board before making a move. Most versions have a "Hint" button if you get stuck.


### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Is Bejeweled free to play?**  **A:** It varies. The original classic versions (like *Bejeweled 2* or *3*) are typically paid games. However, modern versions like *Bejeweled Blitz* or *Bejeweled Stars* on mobile are free-to-play but include in-app purchases and advertisements. 

**Q: What happens when there are "No More Moves"?**  **A:** In Classic Mode, if the board reaches a state where no possible swaps can create a match, the game ends. In some versions, the game might automatically reshuffle the board for you. 

**Q: What is the difference between Bejeweled Classic and Bejeweled Blitz?**  **A:** Bejeweled Classic is a slower, more strategic, and untimed puzzle experience. Bejeweled Blitz is a fast-paced, 60-second competition where the goal is to get the highest score possible, often competing with friends on social media.
