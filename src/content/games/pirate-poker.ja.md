### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pirate Poker is a classic five-card draw poker game with a swashbuckling pirate theme. You'll sit at a table with salty pirate opponents, betting your gold doubloons and trying to build the best possible five-card hand. The game involves rounds of betting, a chance to exchange your cards to improve your hand, and a final showdown to see who wins the pot. It's a game of strategy, psychology, and a little bit of luck.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Know the Hand Rankings:** The goal is to make the best five-card hand. From highest to lowest, the standard rankings are: Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, and High Card.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **The Draw Phase:** After the first round of betting, you'll have a chance to discard some of your cards and draw new ones. This is your chance to improve your hand. If you have a pair, discard the other three cards. If you are close to a Straight or a Flush, discard the one card that doesn't fit.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Betting Strategy:** Don't be afraid to "Fold" if you have a very weak hand and the bets are getting high. Sometimes, you can "Bluff" by betting aggressively with a weak hand to try and scare your opponents into folding.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Reading Your Opponents:** Pay attention to how your opponents are betting. If an opponent makes a very large bet, they likely have a strong hand (or are bluffing!). If they just "Check" (bet nothing), their hand might be weak.
