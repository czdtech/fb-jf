### Detailed Game Introduction

Jungle Bricks is a captivating and modern take on the classic brick-breaker genre. Set in a vibrant jungle, the game challenges players to clear an ever-advancing wall of numbered bricks. Unlike traditional brick-breakers where you control a paddle, here you aim and shoot a volley of balls from a fixed point. Each brick has a durability number that you must reduce to zero to destroy it. The goal is to survive for as long as possible by strategically clearing the bricks before they reach the bottom of the screen.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Aim for Angles:** The key to a high score is maximizing the number of hits per shot. Avoid shooting straight up. Instead, aim for the sides of the screen or gaps between bricks to create complex ricochets. A well-aimed shot can have your balls bouncing around the screen for a long time, clearing multiple bricks at once.
2.  **Prioritize High-Threat Bricks:** Always focus on the bricks that are closest to the bottom of the screen. A single brick touching the bottom line will end your game, so clearing these should be your top priority.
3.  **Look for Power-ups:** Some bricks may contain power-ups, such as extra balls. Targeting these can dramatically increase your clearing power for subsequent turns.
4.  **Plan for the Descent:** After every shot, all bricks on the screen will move one step down. Keep this in mind when planning your shots. A safe-looking board can become dangerous in just a few turns if you don't clear bricks efficiently.
