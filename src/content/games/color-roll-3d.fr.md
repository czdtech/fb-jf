### Detailed Game Introduction

Color Roll 3D presents layered strips you unroll to cover a board exactly. The trick is sequencing: later strips may cover earlier ones, so you must choose an order that matches the target image without overlap errors.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Start with the deepest/base color that covers the largest area.
2.  **[FR]** Place boundary strips to frame shapes, then fill interiors.
3.  **[FR]** Watch overlaps — avoid burying needed edges under later strips.
4.  **[FR]** Undo early when the final gaps look impossible.
5.  **[FR]** Compare with the target preview after each placement.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to unroll a strip along its path; tap to undo where allowed.
- Zoom/pan if supported for precision.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I always end with one tile uncovered — what’s wrong?

A: Your order is off. Lay base colors first, then smaller detail strips to avoid blocking.

- Q: Are multiple orders valid?

A: Some puzzles allow several, but most intend a small set of correct sequences.

- Q: Is there a hint system?

A: Many versions include hints — use sparingly to preserve the challenge.
