### Detailed Game Introduction

Cricket World Cup focuses on batting scenarios: judge line and length, choose ground shots or lofts, and place the ball through gaps to beat set targets over limited overs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Shot selection by line: Leg‑side late glances vs pads; off‑side drives for wide lines.
2.  Risk management: Favor ground shots when deep fielders are set.
3.  Rotate strike: Take singles to keep the board moving when boundaries dry up.
4.  Power plays: Attack gaps when field is up.
5.  Watch bowler rhythm: Time swings from release, not only ball flight.
