### **Game Introduction**

*Pin the UFO* is a charming and strategic "pull the pin" puzzle game set in outer space. The primary objective is to **safely guide a group of colorful alien "cubs" into their UFO spaceship at the bottom of the screen.**

Each level consists of a container holding the aliens, sectioned off by a series of movable pins. The player must analyze the puzzle and pull the pins out in the correct order to release the aliens and let gravity do the rest.

The game introduces several key mechanics:
*   **Color Spreading**: Some aliens start off colorless (white or grey). They must come into contact with the colored aliens to gain color before they can be collected.
*   **Obstacles**: Levels often contain hazards like bombs or explosives. The aliens must be kept away from these dangers.
*   **Physics**: The game is based on simple physics. You must understand how the balls will fall, mix, and flow once a pin is removed.

The challenge lies in figuring out the precise sequence of pin-pulls to ensure all colorless aliens are colored, all hazards are avoided, and all aliens successfully reach the UFO.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

1.  **Plan Before You Pull**: This is the most important rule. Do not pull pins randomly. Take a moment to look at the entire setup and mentally trace the path the aliens will take for each possible pin-pull.
2.  **Color the Grey Aliens First**: Your top priority in most levels is to ensure the colorless aliens mix with the colored ones. Often, you will need to pull a pin that allows the colored aliens to drop down onto the colorless ones *before* you release them all towards the exit.
3.  **Isolate and Neutralize Bombs**: If there are bombs, the puzzle is usually about finding a way to either drop the bombs into a separate, harmless area, or to release the aliens in a way that they flow around the bombs. Never drop the aliens directly onto bombs.
4.  **The Order Matters**: The sequence in which you pull the pins is everything. Pulling pin A before pin B might lead to success, while pulling B before A leads to failure. Think of it like a combination lock.
5.  **Look for Separators**: Some pins are there just to keep things separate (e.g., bombs from aliens, colored aliens from colorless ones). Understand the function of each pin before you remove it.

### **Controls Guide**

The controls are extremely simple and designed for one-touch mobile gameplay.

*   **Pull a Pin**: **Click and drag** the pin you want to remove out of its slot. Alternatively, a simple **tap** on the end of the pin often works as well.

### **Frequently Asked questions (FAQ)**

**1. Why did I lose the level? All the aliens got to the UFO!**
You likely failed to color all the colorless (grey/white) aliens. Only colored aliens count as being successfully "saved." Make sure every alien has been colored before they enter the spaceship.

**2. I pulled a pin, and everything exploded. What did I do wrong?**
You allowed the aliens to come into contact with a bomb. The solution to these levels involves finding a way to get rid of the bombs first, or guiding the aliens along a path that safely avoids them.

**3. The level seems impossible. What should I do?**
Every level has a specific solution. If you are stuck, try to rethink the order of your pin-pulls. The solution is often counter-intuitive. Consider pulling a pin that doesn't seem to lead directly to the exit, but instead sets up a better flow for the aliens.

**4. What is the goal of the game?**
The goal is to successfully solve each puzzle level by getting all the colored aliens into the UFO, progressing through as many levels as possible.
