### Detailed Game Introduction

Elite Chess provides a streamlined chess experience against scalable AI or a local opponent. Improvement hinges on three pillars: (1) Opening principles — rapid development, king safety, and active piece placement; (2) Middlegame tactics — forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks, deflections; (3) Endgames — king activity, opposition, basic checkmates, and practical rook endings. Puzzles and adjustable levels help build calculation depth and pattern recall.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Openings: Occupy the center (pawns e4/d4/c4), develop knights before bishops, castle early, connect rooks.
2.  **[KO]** Tactics scan: On every move, run “CCT” — Checks, Captures, Threats; look for forcing moves.
3.  **[KO]** Pawn structure: Avoid unnecessary weaknesses (isolated/doubled/backward pawns); fix targets, seize open files.
4.  **[KO]** Endgames: Activate your king, study K+Q vs K, K+R vs K, basic king‑pawn opposition, and Lucena/Philidor rook techniques.
5.  **[KO]** Time management: When low on time, choose simple, healthy moves over deep complications.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: How do I stop blundering pieces?

A: Before every move, blunder‑check your king and loose pieces; run CCT for both sides to catch tactics.

- Q: Which openings should I start with?

A: For White try Italian (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4) or Queen’s Gambit (1.d4 d5 2.c4). For Black use Caro‑Kann/Sicilian vs 1.e4 and Slav/Queen’s Gambit Declined vs 1.d4.

- Q: What endgames give fastest rating gain?

A: King‑pawn fundamentals and rook endings; they occur most frequently and convert advantages reliably.
