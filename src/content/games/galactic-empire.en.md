<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
RTS‑lite in space: mine resources, expand bases, and assemble fleets to defend and conquer neighboring sectors.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Build extractors and generators first to stabilize economy.
- Produce a balanced fleet (fighters, frigates, capital ships) and defend chokepoints.
- Capture adjacent nodes to unlock upgrades and map control.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Mouse` to select/build; hotkeys for production and camera vary by host.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Queue ships in batches; constant production beats idle docks.
- Scout before pushing; avoid overextending into multiple waves.
- Focus fire on glass‑cannon threats, then clean up.
