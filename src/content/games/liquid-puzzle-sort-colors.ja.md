### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Liquid puzzle sort colors adapts the viral bottle‑sorting formula: pour liquids between bottles so each ends up uniform. You can pour only onto the same color or an empty bottle. Success demands planning buffers and ordering pours to avoid softlocks where no move remains.
