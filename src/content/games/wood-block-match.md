### Detailed Game Introduction

Wood Block Match is a 10×10‑style block placement game with wooden aesthetics. Each turn you receive a batch of shapes; place them to complete rows/columns and clear space. The session ends when none of the remaining pieces fit — so success is about preserving flexible lanes while engineering multi‑line clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Center breathing room: Keep the board center open; tidy edges to prevent single‑cell traps.
2.  Pocket planning: Reserve a 2×2 or L‑shaped pocket for awkward triominoes.
3.  Hard piece first: When crowded, place the largest/most awkward piece first.
4.  Double clears: Build two‑line setups so one piece clears both.
5.  Undo discipline: If available, undo immediately after a placement that seals pockets.

### Controls Guide

- Drag pieces into the grid; rotate if the mode supports it; clear rows/cols score points.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I run out of space very quickly — what should I change?
  
  A: Protect the center, pre‑plan one pocket for awkward pieces, and prefer double‑clear setups over single clears.

- Q: Can I rotate pieces?
  
  A: Some variants disallow rotation — compensate with better pocketing.

- Q: Any tip for high scores?
  
  A: Chain consecutive double clears and avoid emergency singles that break structure.
