### Detailed Game Introduction

Hoop Stars is a rapid ring‑flip contest. You rotate a ring around a central peg and flip it to land past obstacles. Clean flips that settle over the peg score; misses costs time. Duels reward consistent timing and smart angle setups more than raw speed.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Pre‑spin: Rotate to a comfortable angle before flipping.
2.  **[DE]** Early/late windows: Learn how early vs late flips change arc height.
3.  **[DE]** Obstacle reads: Wait half a cycle for gaps; don’t force throws.
4.  **[DE]** Mind rebounds: If a ring bounces, don’t re‑flip into chaos — reset.
5.  **[DE]** PvP: Bait opponents by faking flips, then land a clean one.

### Controls Guide

- Hold to spin; release to flip; some builds use two buttons for spin vs flip.
