### Detailed Game Introduction

Block Dimension is a captivating puzzle game that takes the classic block-fitting formula into a new dimension. Played on a 10x10 grid, the game challenges you to strategically place blocks of various shapes to clear lines both horizontally and vertically. Unlike traditional block puzzlers, Block Dimension often introduces unique twists and a sleek, modern aesthetic. The goal is to score as many points as possible by clearing lines and creating combos before you run out of space on the board.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Think Ahead:** You are typically shown three block shapes at a time. Before placing the first one, visualize how all three could potentially fit on the board. Good planning is key to long-term survival.
2.  **Keep the Board Open:** Avoid creating single, isolated holes in your structure, as they can be very difficult to fill later. Try to keep your stacks relatively flat and open.
3.  **Aim for Combos:** The most effective way to get a high score is by clearing multiple lines (rows or columns) with a single piece. Look for opportunities to set up these chain reactions.
4.  **Don't Rush:** There is no time limit, so take your time to find the optimal placement for each piece. A single bad move can quickly lead to a game over.
5.  **Manage Large Pieces:** Be mindful of the large, awkward pieces like the 3x3 square. If you don't have a good spot for them, they can quickly clog up your board.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:block-dimension:q-can-i-rotate-the-8b38e9ae -->
  **Q: Can I rotate the blocks?**
    *   **A:** In most 10x10 style block games, including this one, you cannot rotate the blocks. You must use them in the orientation provided, which is a core part of the challenge.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:block-dimension:q-how-do-i-clear-02391945 -->
  **Q: How do I clear lines?**
    *   **A:** A line is cleared when all 10 cells in a horizontal row or a vertical column are filled with blocks. All blocks in that line then disappear, freeing up space.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:block-dimension:q-what-is-the-best-03413fee -->
  **Q: What is the best strategy for a high score?**
    *   **A:** Focus on creating and clearing multiple lines at once. This combo-play gives you significantly more points than clearing single lines. Also, try to play for as long as possible without running out of moves.
