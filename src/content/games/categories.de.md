### Detailed Game Introduction

Categories is a light logic game about sorting items into thematic groups. Identify common links, separate decoys, and solve sets under light timers or move limits.

2.  **[DE]** Test swaps: Move borderline items between plausible groups.
3.  **[DE]** Spot decoys: Items that seem to fit many groups are often misleads.
4.  **[DE]** Manage time: Don’t tunnel—cycle candidates quickly.
5.  **[DE]** Confirm with opposites: If two categories are close, define them by what they exclude.
