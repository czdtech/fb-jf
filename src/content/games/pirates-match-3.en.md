### Detailed Game Introduction

Pirates Match 3 is a classic match-3 puzzle game with a swashbuckling pirate theme. Players dive into a world of treasure maps and pirate booty, swapping colorful, pirate-themed icons like skulls, anchors, ship wheels, and coins. The goal is to create lines of three or more identical items to complete level-specific objectives, such as reaching a target score or clearing special tiles, all within a limited number of moves.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Create Power-ups:** The key to clearing difficult levels is to create special items by matching more than three pieces.
    *   **Match 4:** Creates a line-clearing item that will destroy an entire row or column.
    *   **Match 5 (L or T shape):** Creates a bomb that explodes and clears a large area of surrounding items.
    *   **Match 5 (in a line):** Creates a special item (like a treasure chest) that can clear all items of a single color from the board.

2.  **Combine Power-ups:** For maximum effect, try to swap two power-ups with each other. This will trigger a massive board-clearing combo that can help you complete objectives much faster.
3.  **Focus on the Objective:** Always be aware of the level's goal. If you need to break all the wooden planks in the background, focus your matches on those specific tiles. If you need to drop an item to the bottom, clear the path beneath it.
4.  **Plan Your Moves:** With a limited number of moves per level, every swap counts. Look for moves that will create a cascade or set up a future power-up combination.

### Controls Guide
