### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Tangram Puzzle asks you to arrange seven geometric pieces (tans) to exactly fill a silhouette. No overlaps or gaps; rotations allowed, reflections sometimes banned depending on mode. Recognizing convex/concave pockets and matching corner angles is the key skill.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Corner matching: Seat large triangle corners into silhouette vertices first.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Symmetry read: Split symmetric silhouettes and mirror your half‑solution.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Pocket fills: Use square/parallelogram for tight cavities.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Order of play: Rough‑in with big pieces, then lock gaps with small triangles.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Reflection rules: If reflections are banned, rotate alternatives to simulate flips.

### Controls Guide

- Drag/rotate pieces; flip if allowed; snap assists on correct placement.
