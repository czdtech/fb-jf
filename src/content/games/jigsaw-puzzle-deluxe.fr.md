### Présentation

Un jeu de puzzle jigsaw classique : tu choisis une image, la difficulté (nombre de pièces) et tu assembles le tout à ton rythme.



    - **A:** Drag the pieces around the screen to create space. Group pieces of similar colors or textures together, which will make it easier to find the one you are looking for.

- **Q: The pieces are all jumbled up. How can I organize them?**

    - **A:** The most common strategy is to find all the pieces with a flat edge and assemble the border first. This creates a defined workspace.

- **Q: What is the best way to start a puzzle?**

    - **A:** You can browse the in-game gallery and click on any image you find interesting. After selecting an image, you will usually be prompted to choose a difficulty level (number of pieces).

- **Q: How do I choose a puzzle?**

### Foire aux questions (FAQ)

- **Rotate a Piece (if applicable):** Some difficulty modes may include rotated pieces. There will typically be a button or keyboard key to rotate a selected piece.

- **Move a Piece:** Click and hold on a puzzle piece and drag it to the desired position on the board. Release to drop it into place.


- **Use the Preview:** If you get stuck or forget what the final image looks like, use the "Preview" or "Hint" button to get a quick look at the completed picture for reference.

- **Focus on a Section:** Instead of trying to place pieces randomly, focus on completing one specific area of the picture at a time. For example, try to assemble a single object or building within the image.
The game is played with simple drag-and-drop controls.
