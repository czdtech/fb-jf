### Game Introduction

Geometry Dash Wave is a challenging, rhythm-based platformer that is a popular mode within the Geometry Dash universe. Players control a triangular icon that continuously moves forward through a hazardous course. The unique "wave" mechanic requires precise timing and rhythm to navigate obstacles by changing the icon's diagonal movement.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Wave Mechanic:** Hold down the click/tap to make your icon move diagonally upwards. Release to make it move diagonally downwards. This creates a zigzag path.
- **Rhythm-Based:** The levels are often synchronized with music, and timing your actions to the beat can help you navigate.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The core challenge is to avoid hitting any of the numerous spikes, walls, and other geometric obstacles.
- **Gravity Inversion:** Some levels or sections may invert gravity, reversing the wave controls.

### Controls Guide

- **PC:** `Spacebar`, `Up Arrow Key`, or `Left Mouse Button` to control the wave.
- **Mobile:** Tap and hold the screen to control the wave.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is the main goal of Geometry Dash Wave?**

The main goal is to complete each level by navigating your wave icon through a series of obstacles, reaching the end of the course.

**Is it part of the main Geometry Dash game?**

"Wave" is a specific game mode or a type of level design within the broader Geometry Dash game, often created by players.

Practice is key. Pay attention to the music and the visual cues of the level. Start by playing slower levels to get a feel for the wave mechanic before attempting faster or more complex ones.
