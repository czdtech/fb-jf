### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] "Minesweeper" is a classic single-player puzzle game. The objective is to uncover a grid of squares, find all hidden "mines" without detonating them. Through numerical clues, players can infer the number of mines hidden around each square, gradually clearing safe areas and marking minefields.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Understand Number Meanings**: Each numbered square indicates the count of mines in its eight surrounding adjacent squares.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Mark Safe Areas**: Based on numerical clues, identify squares that are safe to click and uncover.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Mark Minefields**: When a square is determined to be a mine, use a right-click (or long-press) to flag it, avoiding accidental detonation.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Prioritize Certainty**: Focus on areas where mines or safe squares can be definitively determined.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Handle Uncertainty**: In situations without clear clues, make reasonable guesses but try to minimize risk.

### How to Play

*   **Left-click**: Uncover a square.
*   **Right-click (or long-press)**: Flag or unflag a mine.
*   **Double-click Numbered Square**: When all mines around a numbered square have been correctly flagged, double-clicking that numbered square will instantly uncover all surrounding unrevealed safe squares.
