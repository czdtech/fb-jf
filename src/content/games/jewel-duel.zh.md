### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Jewel Duel layers RPG elements onto match‑3 combat. Matching certain colors fuels attacks/defense/skills; enemy turns follow yours, so turn order matters. Some foes carry shields/absorbs that require specific match types, adding puzzle depth beyond raw damage.
