### **Game Introduction**

Clicker Heroes is a quintessential "idle" or "incremental" game where the primary goal is to progress through an effectively infinite number of levels by defeating monsters. The game starts with the player actively clicking on a monster to deal damage and earn gold. This gold is then used to hire heroes who automatically attack monsters, generating Damage Per Second (DPS).

As you purchase and level up more heroes, your DPS grows exponentially, allowing you to defeat monsters faster and earn even more gold. The core gameplay loop involves managing your hero upgrades, using character skills, and deciding when to perform a crucial reset known as "Ascension." This mechanic allows you to restart from level 1 but with powerful permanent bonuses (Hero Souls and Ancients) that drastically accelerate all future runs. The ultimate objective is to see how far you can progress and how powerful you can become.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

The strategy for Clicker Heroes evolves as you play.

**1. The First Run (Before Ascending):**
*   **Initial Phase**: Click the monster to earn your first bits of gold. Hire your first few heroes as soon as you can afford them.
*   **Focus on DPS**: Continuously level up the most cost-effective hero. A good rule of thumb is to upgrade the cheapest hero that gives you the biggest DPS boost.
*   **Unlock Hero Skills**: Leveling heroes to levels 10, 25, 50, 75, etc., unlocks crucial skills that often boost their own damage or the damage of all your heroes. Aim to unlock all skills for each hero before moving to the next.
*   **Pushing Your Limit**: Keep progressing until defeating a boss (every 5th level) becomes very slow or impossible within the 30-second timer. Use your player skills (like Clickstorm, Powersurge) to help push past difficult bosses.
*   **When to Ascend First**: A common recommendation is to ascend for the first time after beating level 139 and leveling your hero Amenhotep to 150 to unlock the "Ascension" skill. This should grant you around 7-10 Hero Souls.

**2. Post-Ascension Strategy (The Real Game Begins):**
*   **Understand Hero Souls (HS)**: This is the most important currency. Each Hero Soul you possess provides a +10% bonus to your total DPS. **Do not spend them all immediately.**
*   **Ancients**: These are powerful beings that provide permanent, game-changing bonuses. You purchase and level them up using Hero Souls. Your choice of Ancients defines your playstyle.
*   **Choose a Playstyle - Idle vs. Active**:
    *   **Idle**: This build focuses on letting the game run in the background. Your heroes do all the work. The key starting Ancients are **Siyalatas** (Bonus Idle DPS) and **Libertas** (Bonus Idle Gold). This is highly recommended for beginners.
    *   **Active**: This build focuses on active clicking and skill usage. The key starting Ancients are **Fragsworth** (Bonus Click Damage) and **Bhaal** (Bonus Critical Click Damage).
*   **The Golden Rule of Ancients**: Use an "Ancients Calculator" (you can find them online). These tools will tell you the most efficient way to spend your Hero Souls to level up your Ancients for maximum progress.
*   **Gilds**: After level 100, you will start receiving Gilds, which are damage multipliers assigned to random heroes. Early on, it's best to consolidate all your Gilds onto one powerful and efficient hero (like The Masked Samurai, Atlas, or Terra as you progress). This focuses your power dramatically.
*   **Efficient Ascensions**: The core of the game is to perform many relatively quick ascensions. Do a run, push as far as you can quickly, ascend to collect Hero Souls, reinvest in Ancients, and repeat. Don't spend days on a single run if progress has stalled.

### **Controls Guide**

The game is primarily mouse-driven, but keyboard shortcuts are essential for efficiency.

*   **Mouse Click**: Click on the monster to deal damage. Click on buttons to hire/level up heroes and activate skills.
*   **Number Keys (1-9)**: Activate your player skills.
*   **Hero Leveling Shortcuts**:
    *   **SHIFT + Click**: Level up a hero 10 times.
    *   **Z + Click**: Level up a hero 25 times.
    *   **CTRL + Click**: Level up a hero 100 times.
    *   **Q + Click**: Level up a hero to the maximum affordable amount.
    *   **A**: Progress to the next level (or toggle auto-progression).

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**1. When should I ascend?**
For your very first run, aim for level 140 to get a handful of Hero Souls. After that, ascend whenever your progress slows down significantly. A good run might last anywhere from 30 to 60 minutes in the mid-game. The key is speed and efficiency.

**2. What are Hero Souls and what do I do with them?**
Hero Souls (HS) are a permanent currency earned by defeating Primal Bosses (bosses on levels 100, 110, 120, etc.) and by leveling up heroes. Each one gives a passive +10% DPS bonus. Their primary use is to summon and level up Ancients.

**3. Should I play an Idle, Active, or Hybrid build?**
For beginners, an **Idle** build is strongly recommended. It is simpler to manage and very powerful for making steady progress. You can switch to an Active or Hybrid build later in the game when you have a large bank of Hero Souls.

**4. All my Gilds are on random, weak heroes. What should I do?**
In the mid-game, you can spend Hero Souls to "de-gild" a hero and move that gild to another random hero. The goal is to consolidate all your Gilds onto one single, powerful hero to maximize your damage output. This process is called "re-gilding."

**5. Is there an end to the game?**
No, Clicker Heroes is designed to be an endless game. The levels and the amount of gold and damage required scale infinitely. The goal is personal progression and reaching ever-higher zones.
