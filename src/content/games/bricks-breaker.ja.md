### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bricks Breaker is a modern take on the timeless arcade classic. The objective is to destroy all the bricks on the screen by hitting them with a bouncing ball. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen to keep the ball in play. As you break bricks, you can collect various power-ups to help you clear levels faster. With numerous levels, challenging brick formations, and exciting power-ups, Bricks Breaker offers endless fun.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Control the Paddle:** Your primary job is to position the paddle to intercept the ball. Try to hit the ball with the edges of the paddle to change its angle and send it to different parts of the screen.
