### How to Play 4 Pics 1 Word

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The gameplay is incredibly simple and intuitive, making it accessible to players of all ages.

*   **The Goal:** Look at the four pictures presented and figure out the one word that they all represent or are associated with. This word can be a noun, verb, or adjective.

*   **Guessing the Word:**
    1.  在图片下方，你会看到一组空白格，代表目标单词的字母。
    2.  再往下是一组打乱的字母选择。
    3.  按正确的顺序点击字母，在空白格中拼出你的答案。
    4.  如果你犯了错误，可以点击答案空格中的字母将其返回到选择区域。

*   **Earning Coins:** For each puzzle you solve correctly, you earn a small number of coins. These coins are the in-game currency used for getting hints.

*   **Using Hints:** If you get stuck on a puzzle, there are several hints you can "purchase" with your earned coins:
    *   **显示一个字母：** 这将把一个正确的字母放入答案中的正确位置。这是最常见和最便宜的提示。
    *   **移除字母：** 这将从打乱的选择中移除几个不属于答案的字母，使猜测单词变得更容易。
    *   **询问朋友：** 游戏提供了一个内置功能，可以截取谜题的屏幕截图，并轻松地在社交媒体或消息应用程序上分享，以寻求帮助。

### Strategy and Tips

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] While the game is simple, a few strategies can help you solve puzzles more efficiently.

1.  **单独分析每张图片：** 首先，用简单的词语向自己描述四张图片中的每一张。寻找动作、物体、颜色或概念。
    *   *示例：* 如果你看到一个人在睡觉、一个关闭的电灯开关、一个黑暗的天空和一只猫头鹰，单个词语可能是"睡眠"、"关闭"、"黑暗"、"夜晚"、"鸟"。

2.  **找到共同主题：** 分析每张图片后，寻找重叠的概念或单词。在上面的例子中，共同主题是**"黑暗"**（一个黑暗的房间、一个黑暗的天空、一个夜晚的生物）。

3.  **抽象思考：** 不要总是字面思考。有时连接是一个概念或想法。
    *   *示例：* 天平、法官的木槌和蒙眼雕像的图片可能都指向单词**"正义"**。

4.  **考虑文字游戏和多重含义：** 游戏经常使用具有双重含义的单词（同音异义词）。
    *   *示例：* 树的外层和狗的声音的图片可能都与单词**"树皮/吠叫"**有关。

5.  **查看字母计数和可用字母：** 空白格的数量准确地告诉你单词有多长。使用提供的字母作为主要线索。如果你有想法，在过于执着之前检查是否有必要的字母可用。

6.  **明智地使用硬币：** "移除字母"提示通常比"显示一个字母"更有价值，因为它可以使答案立即显而易见。为真正困难的谜题保存你的硬币。
