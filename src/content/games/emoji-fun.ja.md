### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Emoji Fun is a creative and thought-provoking puzzle game based on associations. In each level, you are presented with two columns of emojis. Your task is to figure out the relationship between them and draw lines to connect the correct pairs. The connections can be literal (like a sock and a foot) or conceptual (like a ghost and a haunted house). It's a fun test of your logic and lateral thinking.
