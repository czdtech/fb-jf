### Detailed Game Introduction

Foosball Cup World is a quick table‑football simulation with responsive rods and crisp ball physics. Attack relies on angled passes, snap shots, and well‑timed spins; defense is about lane coverage and cutting cross‑shots. Matches are short, demanding precise control over frantic flailing.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Short passes: Tap to nudge the ball between adjacent rows, then snap‑shoot.
2.  Cover lanes: Park defenders to block central lanes; move only when needed.
3.  Angle finishes: Hit the ball on the outside of the foot for far‑post angles.
4.  Anti‑spin: For stability, avoid full‑rod spins that lose control.
5.  Kickoffs: Shoot diagonally off kickoff before the opponent settles.

### Controls Guide

- Move rods: WASD/Arrows/mouse drag (varies).  Shoot: Tap/flick; some builds separate tilt vs spin.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Are full 360° spins allowed?
  
  A: Many foosball rules forbid them; the game often discourages them with poor control.

- Q: Best basic defense?
  
  A: Keep one defender centered and the goalie tracking the ball’s angle; avoid chasing.

- Q: Two‑player support?
  
  A: Commonly yes via shared keyboard or local hot‑seat.
