### Detailed Game Introduction

Golf Adventures is a fun and imaginative puzzle game that uses the mechanics of golf. Instead of a realistic golf course, you'll find yourself in a series of creative and challenging levels filled with unique obstacles. The goal is simple: get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. It's a game of angles, power, and clever problem-solving.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Plan Your Shot:** Before you shoot, take a look at the entire level. Observe the obstacles, the slopes, and the position of the hole. The shortest path is not always the best one.
2.  **[DE]** **Master the Power:** The distance you pull back determines the power of your shot. Getting a feel for how much power is needed for different distances is key. Start with gentle shots until you get a feel for the physics.
3.  **[DE]** **Use the Environment:** Many levels are designed for you to use the walls and obstacles to your advantage. Bouncing the ball off a wall (a "bank shot") might be the only way to get around an obstacle and close to the hole.
4.  **[DE]** **Aim for Par or Better:** Each hole has a "Par," which is the target number of strokes for a skilled player. Your goal is to meet or beat par (a "Birdie" is one under par, an "Eagle" is two under).

### Controls Guide

The game uses a simple drag-and-release mechanic.

*   **[DE]** **Aim and Set Power:** Click on the golf ball and hold the mouse button. Drag your cursor away from the ball. A line will appear showing your aim, and the distance you drag determines the power.
*   **[DE]** **Shoot:** Release the mouse button to hit the ball.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: What does "Par" mean?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** Par is the expected number of strokes it should take to complete a hole. If a hole is a Par 3, your goal is to get the ball in the hole in 3 strokes or fewer.

*   **[DE]** **Q: What happens if my ball goes into a water hazard?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** Your ball will be returned to its previous position, and you will receive a one-stroke penalty.

*   **[DE]** **Q: How do I get past a large wall?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** Look for ramps or other objects. Some levels require you to hit the ball up a ramp to launch it over an obstacle. Other times, you may need to bounce it off another wall to get around.
