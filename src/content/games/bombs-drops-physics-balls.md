### Detailed Game Introduction

Bombs Drops Physics balls mixes gravity, timing, and simple demolition. Drop balls or bombs onto contraptions, topple stacks, and trigger chain reactions to meet level goals. The fun is in finding minimal, elegant solutions that use physics in your favor.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Scout weak points: Hit supports, wedges, or tensioned pieces to collapse structures efficiently.
2.  Time cascades: Delay second drops so the first impact sets the stage.
3.  Use angles: Side hits create torque and bigger topples than straight drops.
4.  Minimize drops: Fewer, smarter drops often beat spammy solutions.
5.  Reset often: Quick retries help you iterate on timing and angles.

### Controls Guide

- Aim and drop with mouse/touch; some levels allow limited nudges.
- Reset/Undo where available for fast iteration.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My drops barely move anything—what am I missing?
  
  A: You’re striking center mass. Target edges and supports to generate torque and collapses.

- Q: Is there scoring for fewer drops?
  
  A: Many levels bonus minimal solutions; aim to complete with spare bombs.

- Q: Do levels require perfect timing?
  
  A: A few do, but most reward clear planning more than twitch timing.
