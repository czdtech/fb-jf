### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Spider Solitaire is one of the most popular and challenging variations of solitaire. Played with two full decks of cards, the objective is to clear the tableau by building eight complete descending sequences of a single suit, from King down to Ace. Once a full sequence is completed, it is removed from play. The game is renowned for its difficulty and the strategic depth required to win, especially when played with two or four suits.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **The Goal:** To build eight sequences of cards within the tableau, each from King to Ace in a single suit. Once a full K-to-A sequence is formed, it is automatically removed from the board. The game is won when the tableau is empty.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Moving Cards:** You can place any card onto another card that is one rank higher. For example, you can place a 7 of any suit onto an 8 of any suit. However, you can only move a *group* of cards together if they are all of the *same suit* and in perfect descending order (e.g., you can move a 9♠-8♠-7♠ sequence together).
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Uncovering Cards:** The primary strategy is to uncover the face-down cards in the tableau as quickly as possible to give yourself more options.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Empty Columns:** An empty column can be filled with any card or any valid sequence of cards. Use these empty spaces strategically to rearrange your tableau and organize your suits.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Dealing from the Stock:** When you have no more productive moves, you can click the stock pile. This will deal one new face-up card to the bottom of each of the ten tableau columns. **Important:** You cannot deal new cards if any of your tableau columns are empty.
