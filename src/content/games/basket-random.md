### Detailed Introduction

*Basket Random* is a chaotic and hilarious physics-based basketball game defined by its extreme randomness. The game pits two teams of two ragdoll-like players against each other on a 2D court. The objective is simple: be the first team to score 5 points.

What makes the game unique is that almost everything changes with every point scored. The court might become long, short, or icy. The players might get long arms, big heads, or become bouncy. Even the ball itself can change, transforming from a standard basketball into a football, a bowling ball, or even a smaller, faster ball.

Players have extremely limited control over their characters, who move and jump in an unwieldy, floppy manner. The gameplay is less about precise skill and more about mastering the timing of a single button press to jump, flail, and hopefully guide the ball into the opponent's hoop. This unpredictable nature makes every match a frantic and comical experience.

### Gameplay Strategy

Winning in *Basket Random* is about taming the chaos, not controlling it.

1.  **Embrace the Chaos:** The first and most important rule is to accept that you cannot fully control your players. They will stumble, fall, and spin unpredictably. The goal is to influence their actions at the right moment, not dictate their every move.
2.  **Master Your Timing:** Since you only have one button, *when* you press it is the only skill that matters.
    *   **On Offense:** Press the button to jump towards the ball or to perform a "shooting" motion when you have it. Sometimes a well-timed jump can launch the ball from your hands directly into the basket.
    *   **On Defense:** Timing your jump correctly can block an opponent's shot or even steal the ball mid-air. Get your player between the ball and your basket.
3.  **Use Your Opponent (and Teammate):** The physics engine applies to everyone. Bumping into other players can knock the ball loose or change their trajectory. You can even inadvertently use another player's head as a platform to jump higher.
4.  **Adapt Instantly to New Conditions:** After every point, take a split second to assess the new random elements. Is the court now covered in ice? Is the ball heavy? Are your arms comically long? Your strategy must change immediately. For example, on an icy court, you'll slide more, so you need to press the button earlier to account for the drift.
5.  **Positional Awareness:** Despite the randomness, try to keep your players in a useful position. On defense, stay closer to your own basket. On offense, try to get under the ball to propel it toward the opponent's hoop.

### Controls Guide

The game is famous for its extremely simple, single-button control scheme, designed for two players on one keyboard.

*   **Player 1:**
    *   **`W` Key** or **`Up Arrow` Key**: Jump / Fling arms.
*   **Player 2:**
    *   **`Up Arrow` Key** or **`W` Key**: Jump / Fling arms. (The controls depend on the specific version, but it's always one key per player).
*   **For Mobile / Touchscreen Devices:**
    *   Tap on the respective side of the screen (left side for Player 1, right side for Player 2).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. How do I properly control my character?**
You don't—and that's the point of the game! You can only influence your character by timing your jumps. The ragdoll physics are designed to be clumsy and unpredictable for comedic effect.

**2. Why does the court/ball/player change after every point?**
This is the core "Random" mechanic of the game. It ensures that no two rounds are the same and keeps the gameplay fresh and unpredictable.

**3. How do I win a match?**
The first player (or team) to score 5 points wins the entire match.

**4. Can I play this game by myself?**
Yes, *Basket Random* includes a single-player mode where you can compete against a computer-controlled AI opponent.

**5. What is the best "random" variation?**
There is no "best" variation, as they are all designed to be chaotic. However, some players find the long-armed players useful for blocking and shooting, while others enjoy the challenge of a heavy bowling ball or an icy court. The fun comes from adapting to whatever the game throws at you.
