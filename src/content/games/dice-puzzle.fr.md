### Detailed Game Introduction

Dice Puzzle is a clever and strategic puzzle game that blends logic with a bit of luck. The objective is to place dice onto a 5x5 grid and merge them to create higher-value dice. By matching three or more adjacent dice of the same number, you combine them into a single die of the next higher number. The ultimate goal is to create special jewel cubes by merging dice with the number 6, which helps clear the board and achieve a high score. The game ends when the board is full and you can no longer place a die.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **The Merge Rule:** The core of the game is matching three or more identical dice that are adjacent to each other (in a line or cluster). They will then merge into a single die of the next number (e.g., three '4s' become one '5').
2.  **[FR]** **Plan Your Placements:** Don't just place a die in the first available spot. Look at the existing dice on the board and try to place your new die where it can either complete a set of three or set up a future merge.
3.  **[FR]** **Rotate for a Better Fit:** You can rotate the die before you place it. Use this to your advantage to position it perfectly for a merge.
4.  **[FR]** **Aim for the Jewel Cube:** The most powerful move is to merge three dice with the number 6. This creates a special jewel cube that will explode, clearing a 3x3 area around it. This is crucial for freeing up space on the board and extending your game.

### Controls Guide

*   **[FR]** **Rotate Die:** Click on the die in the holding area to rotate it before placing it.
*   **[FR]** **Place Die:** Click on an empty square on the 5x5 grid to place the current die.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[FR]** **Q: How do I merge dice?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** Place at least three dice with the same number so that they are touching each other horizontally or vertically. They will merge automatically.

*   **[FR]** **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** The goal is to get the highest score possible by surviving as long as you can. You do this by continuously merging dice and clearing space to prevent the board from filling up.

*   **[FR]** **Q: What happens when I merge three '6' dice?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** Merging three 6-dot dice creates a special jewel cube. On your next merge involving this jewel, it will trigger a small explosion, clearing the 3x3 area around it and giving you a large point bonus.
