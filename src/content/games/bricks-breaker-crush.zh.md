### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bricks Breaker Crush fires barrages of balls that ricochet through numbered bricks. Your aim sets the initial trajectory; bricks count down as they’re hit. Mastery is about shaping long ricochet paths, multiplying contacts per volley, and preventing walls from reaching the bottom.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Shallow angles: Start at modest angles to maximize side‑to‑side hits.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Target multipliers: Hit +ball pickups early to scale your volleys.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Cut columns: Remove high‑value columns that threaten the bottom.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Set traps: Build V‑shaped lanes so balls loop near the top for extended time on target.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Emergency clears: When a row is critical, aim direct shots to neutralize it before it drops.
6.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Power‑ups: Save line clears for emergencies; chain with big volleys when possible.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to aim; release to fire the volley.
- Power‑ups trigger on catch or tap depending on the build.
