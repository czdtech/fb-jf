### Overview
Gladihoppers blends ragdoll‑style hopping movement with weapon combat. Your gladiator’s stance, reach, and momentum determine damage: lunges and head hits deal more, while shields and timing‑based parries mitigate blows. Between fights, equip new helms, armor, and weapons to shape reach and swing speed, then progress through arenas and modes.

### How to Play
- Control distance with hops; strike when your weapon arc will land first.
- Raise shield or back‑hop to bait swings, then counter during recovery.
- Spend coins on gear that complements your preferred range and speed.

### Controls
- Directional hops, attack and block keys (bindings vary by host); local versus often available.

### Tips
- Spear/pike favor spacing; swords excel at close pressure.
- Aim for the head when safe; high hits often crit.
- Don’t spam—most weapons have end‑lag; learn tempos.

### FAQ
- Q: Why do my attacks whiff at close range?  
  A: Your weapon arc may be past its sweet spot; adjust spacing or switch to faster arms.
- Q: Is blocking or back‑hopping better on defense?  
  A: Use both—block against single swings, back‑hop to escape combos.
- Q: How important is gear quality?  
  A: Very—reach/weight drastically change matchups.
