### Detailed Game Introduction

Kitty Scramble presents themed letter grids (animals, foods, places). Swipe contiguous letters in any direction to form target words; extra words grant coins. Boards escalate with longer words, diagonal paths, and overlapping targets that require flexible pathing and good vocabulary.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Theme scan: Pre‑list likely words from the theme before swiping.
2.  **[DE]** Pattern anchors: Look for repeated bigrams/trigrams (TH, ING, EST) to seed paths.
3.  **[DE]** Overlaps: When a word blocks another, find an alternate route using diagonals.
4.  **[DE]** Bonus economy: Bank extra words early to save hints for late boards.
5.  **[DE]** Systematic sweep: Scan rows then columns to avoid misses.

### Controls Guide

- Drag across letters to form words; release to submit; use hints sparingly.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I see the word but can’t draw it — why?

A: The letters may not be contiguous; route diagonally or in a zig‑zag where allowed.

- Q: Are plurals allowed?

A: Usually yes unless excluded by the list.

- Q: Can I replay for coins?

A: Yes — farm early boards for extra hints.
