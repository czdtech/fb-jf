### Detailed Game Introduction

Pool 8 Ball Mania simulates casual 8‑ball with responsive aiming and spin. The core is cue‑ball control: land shape for the next shot, use topspin to follow, backspin to draw, and sidespin off rails to manage lines.

3.  **[FR]** Spin sparing: Small top/back/side spin corrections are safer.
4.  **[FR]** Pattern clears: Resolve clusters and problem balls early.
5.  **[FR]** Safety: If the pot is thin and risky, play safe to leave the opponent tough.
