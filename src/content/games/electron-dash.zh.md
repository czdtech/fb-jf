### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Fast tunnel runner: sprint along cylinders and platforms, leap gaps, and dash across floating tiles while the pace steadily increases.

### How to Play
- Read tile patterns ahead; jump between lanes and dash across short voids.
- Blue tiles may collapse; moving rings require precise timing.
- Push for distance and gems where present.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; Space/X to dash (host dependent).

### Tips
- Center your lane before blind rises; camera shifts can mislead footing.
- Chain dash→jump to cross long gaps; don’t spam dash on unstable tiles.
- Treat curves like lanes—switch early, not on the lip.
