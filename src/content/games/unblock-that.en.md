### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Identify the Main Blockers:** Look at the red block and identify the blocks that are directly in its path to the exit. Your first goal is to move these primary blockers.
2.  **Create Space:** To move a blocking piece, you often need to move other pieces first to create empty space. Look for smaller blocks that can be shuffled around easily to open up pathways.
3.  **Think Several Moves Ahead:** Don't just make random moves. Try to visualize the sequence of moves required to clear the path. The best players think several steps ahead to solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible.
4.  **Don't Be Afraid to Reset:** If you get into a situation where the blocks are completely jammed and you can't see a solution, sometimes the best option is to reset the level and start again with a fresh approach.
