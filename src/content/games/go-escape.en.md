### Detailed Game Introduction

Go Escape is a minimalist room‑escape platformer: spikes, moving saws, and timed gates demand crisp inputs and patient reads. Levels are short but punishing; the fun lies in mastering each room’s rhythm, then executing a clean run.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Read cycles: Watch a full trap cycle before committing; move on predictable beats.
2.  Short hops: Prefer small taps for precision over full presses that overshoot.
3.  Buffer inputs: If supported, press slightly early to catch platform windows.
4.  Route safety: Take slower, safer lanes first for consistent clears.
5.  Checkpoint mindset: Mentally segment rooms; reset focus after each success.
