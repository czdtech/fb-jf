### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Geometry Dash Wave is a challenging, rhythm-based platformer that is a popular mode within the Geometry Dash universe. Players control a triangular icon that continuously moves forward through a hazardous course. The unique "wave" mechanic requires precise timing and rhythm to navigate obstacles by changing the icon's diagonal movement.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Wave Mechanic:** Hold down the click/tap to make your icon move diagonally upwards. Release to make it move diagonally downwards. This creates a zigzag path.
- **Rhythm-Based:** The levels are often synchronized with music, and timing your actions to the beat can help you navigate.
- **Obstacle Avoidance:** The core challenge is to avoid hitting any of the numerous spikes, walls, and other geometric obstacles.
- **Gravity Inversion:** Some levels or sections may invert gravity, reversing the wave controls.

### Controls Guide

- **PC:** `Spacebar`, `Up Arrow Key`, or `Left Mouse Button` to control the wave.
- **Mobile:** Tap and hold the screen to control the wave.
