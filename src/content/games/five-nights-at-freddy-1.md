### Overview
You’re the night guard at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza. Watch cameras, manage limited power, and keep Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy from entering your office.

### How to Play
- Check cameras to track animatronics; listen for audio cues.
- Close doors and toggle lights sparingly—everything drains power.
- Survive each shift from 12 a.m. to 6 a.m.; later nights speed up AI.

### Controls
- Mouse/UI for cameras, lights, and doors; Esc for pause (host dependent).

### Tips
- Learn Foxy’s Pirate Cove behavior; peeking cadence signals risk.
- Don’t camp cameras; short, purposeful checks save power.
- Use audio cues to know when a door light check is needed.

### FAQ
- Q: Is 6th/Custom Night included?  
  A: Many hosts include Night 6 and a custom AI night.
- Q: Why did I run out of power?  
  A: Over‑checking cameras/doors; streamline your loop.
- Q: Can I mute calls?  
  A: Some versions allow muting the Phone Guy’s intro.
