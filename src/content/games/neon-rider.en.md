### Detailed Game Introduction

Neon Rider is a side‑view bike‑physics platformer focused on smooth landings and momentum. Control pitch mid‑air, manage throttle over bumps, and chain jumps without over‑rotating to keep speed.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Land flat: Aim to touch down with wheels level to retain speed.
2.  Tap throttle: Feather power on bumpy terrain to avoid nose dives.
3.  Early corrections: Start pitch corrections in the air, not on landing.
4.  Small flips only: Flip when safe and with enough arc; unnecessary flips bleed speed.
5.  Learn lines: Memorize jump lengths and landing spots for perfect flow.
