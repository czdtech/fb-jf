### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Football Penalty focuses on spot‑kicks. As the taker, you must select placement, height, and power while disguising intent. As the keeper (in some modes), you read the run‑up and dive accordingly. Clean corners, low drives, and late disguise beat average AI.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Corners: Aim low corners for harder saves; high corners are strong but risk the bar.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Disguise: Vary run‑up angles and shoot late to avoid telegraphing.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Power: Medium‑high power keeps shots quick without ballooning.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Keeper mode: Move late and dive toward foot/open‑body side.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mind wind (if modeled): Offset slightly and reduce height.

### Controls Guide

- Aim with mouse; set power with a press/hold; add swerve by dragging (if supported).
