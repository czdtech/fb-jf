### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Garden Bloom is a relaxing and creative game that beautifully blends classic match-3 puzzles with garden design and restoration. Players are tasked with transforming a neglected garden back to its former glory. The core of the game involves completing match-3 levels, where you swap colorful flowers and other garden elements to achieve specific goals. Successfully beating a level rewards you with stars, which act as the currency to perform tasks in the garden, such as cleaning up, planting flowers, and placing beautiful decorations.

*   **Q: What happens if I run out of moves in a puzzle?**
     *   **A:** If you fail to complete the objective within the move limit, you will lose a life. You can either wait for your lives to regenerate over time or use in-game coins to get extra moves or a refill.
