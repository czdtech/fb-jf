### Detailed Game Introduction

Krishna Jump is a one‑button vertical runner. Time jumps to leap between platforms, avoid spikes and moving enemies, and snag collectibles for bonuses. Later levels add disappearing tiles and shifting speeds that demand steady rhythm and quick reads.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Count beats: Tap on a steady cadence to normalize jump timing.
2.  Aim centers: Land mid‑platform to allow corrections.
3.  Read ahead: Watch 2–3 platforms up to plan safe arcs.
4.  Skip greed: Abandon risky side coins when alignment is poor.
5.  Recover cadence: After a miss, take a breath and re‑establish rhythm.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click to jump; hold may increase height depending on build; pause via UI.

- Q: Are double jumps available?
  
  A: Some stages grant temporary double jump; watch HUD prompts.

- Q: Endless or level‑based?
