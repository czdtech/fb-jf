### Detailed Game Introduction

Tower Mania is an engaging and addictive arcade game that challenges your precision and timing. The objective is simple: build the tallest possible tower by carefully stacking blocks one on top of another. Blocks swing back and forth, and you must tap or click at the precise moment to drop them perfectly aligned. Any part of a block that hangs off will be cut away, making the next level smaller and increasing the difficulty. Test your steady hand and keen eye to reach new heights and achieve the ultimate high score!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Timing is Crucial:** The core of the game is timing your tap perfectly. Watch the swinging block and try to release it when it's directly over the center of the block below. Precision is rewarded.
2.  **[DE]** **Start Slow and Steady:** Don't rush in the beginning. Take your time to get a feel for the block's swing speed and the rhythm of the game. A solid foundation is key to a tall tower.
3.  **[DE]** **Focus on the Center:** Always aim for the center. Even if you miss slightly, try to keep the main mass of the tower as central as possible to maintain stability.
4.  **[DE]** **Adapt to Smaller Blocks:** As you make imperfect drops, the base of your tower will shrink. You'll need to adapt your timing and precision to these smaller targets.
5.  **[DE]** **Use Power-ups (if available):** Some versions of Tower Mania might offer power-ups that can help stabilize your tower or give you a perfect drop. Use them strategically when the tower gets very high and unstable.

### Controls Guide

*   **[DE]** **Drop Block:** Click the left mouse button or tap the screen to release the swinging block.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: What is the goal of Tower Mania?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The main goal is to build the tallest possible tower by stacking blocks accurately. The game ends when a block falls off the tower.

*   **[DE]** **Q: How do I get a higher score?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** Your score is determined by the height of your tower. The more blocks you stack successfully, the higher your score will be.

*   **[DE]** **Q: What happens if a block isn't perfectly aligned?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** If a block is not perfectly aligned, any part of it that extends beyond the block below will be cut off. This makes the next block you drop have a smaller surface area to land on, increasing the difficulty.
