### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Master the Swipes:** The core gameplay relies on quick reflexes. You need to swipe left and right to switch between three lanes, swipe up to jump over low obstacles, and swipe down to slide under high ones. Practice timing your swipes perfectly.
2.  **Grab Those Power-ups:** During your run, you will see special items. Always try to grab them!
    *   **Magnet:** Automatically collects all nearby coins for a short period.
    *   **Rocket/Jetpack:** Launches you into the air, allowing you to fly safely above all obstacles while collecting coins.
    *   **Double Coins:** Doubles the value of every coin you collect for a limited time.
3.  **Focus on Missions:** The game will give you missions to complete during your run (e.g., "Jump 10 times," "Collect 200 coins"). Completing these missions is the fastest way to increase your score multiplier and earn bonus rewards.
4.  **Upgrade Your Boosters:** Use the coins you collect to upgrade the duration and effectiveness of your power-ups in the main menu. A longer-lasting magnet or rocket can dramatically improve your scores.
