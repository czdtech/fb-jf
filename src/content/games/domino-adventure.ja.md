### **コントロール Guide**
**1. How do I win a round?**（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Domino Adventure* is a beautifully presented digital version of the classic dominoes board game. The objective is to be the first player to **play all of your domino tiles** by strategically matching them to the ends of the domino chain on the table.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Each player starts with a hand of domino tiles. On your turn, you must place a tile from your hand that has a number of pips (dots) matching one of the open ends of the chain on the board. The game ends when one player runs out of tiles, or when all players are "blocked" and can no longer make a legal move.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The winner of a round scores points equal to the total number of pips left in their opponents' hands. The game is played over several rounds until one player reaches a pre-set score target (e.g., 15 points as shown in the screenshot).

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Play Your Doubles Early**: Double-sided tiles (like double-fives or double-threes) are less versatile because they only have one number to match. Playing them early prevents them from getting stuck in your hand later when you have fewer options.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Keep a Variety of Numbers**: Try to keep a diverse range of numbers in your hand. If you only have tiles with high numbers (fives and sixes), and the ends of the chain are all low numbers, you'll be blocked.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Block Your Opponent**: Pay attention to the numbers your opponent is playing. If you notice they are avoiding a certain number, it's likely they don't have it. If you have the opportunity, try to leave that number exposed on both ends of the chain to block them and force them to pass their turn (in Block mode) or draw a new tile (in Draw mode).
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Play Your Heaviest Tiles First**: If you anticipate that you might not win the round, it's a good strategy to play your tiles with the highest total number of pips first. This minimizes the number of points your opponent will score off you if they win.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Know the Game Modes**:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Block Mode**: If you cannot play a tile, you must pass your turn. This mode is more about strategically blocking your opponent.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Draw Mode**: If you cannot play a tile, you must draw a new tile from the boneyard until you get one you can play. This mode involves more luck.

### **Controls Guide**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is designed for simple, intuitive drag-and-drop or click-based gameplay.

*   **Play a Tile**: **Click and drag** a domino from your rack to a valid matching end on the board. Alternatively, you can often just **click** the tile you want to play, and it will automatically move to a valid spot if one exists.
