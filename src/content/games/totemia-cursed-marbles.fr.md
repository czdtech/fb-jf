### Foire aux questions (FAQ)


Totemia: Cursed Marbles is a thrilling action-puzzle game in the style of classic marble shooters like Zuma or Luxor. A chain of cursed, colored marbles is rolling along a path towards a secret chamber. You control a powerful tiki stone that shoots marbles. Your objective is to destroy the entire chain by shooting marbles to create matches of three or more of the same color before the first marble reaches the end of the line.
- **Swap Marbles:** You can typically right-click or press the spacebar to swap between the two marbles in your shooter.

- **Shoot:** Click the left mouse button to fire the marble.

- **Aim:** Move your mouse to aim the tiki stone shooter.

### Commandes

- **Swap Marbles:** Your tiki shooter often holds two marbles. If the current color isn't useful, you can swap it with the next one to make a better strategic shot.

- **Use Power-ups:** Look for special marbles that appear in the chain. Shooting these can grant you powerful abilities, like a Fireball that can destroy any marbles it hits, or a Lightning bolt that zaps a section of the chain.

- **Shoot Through Gaps:** Don't be afraid to shoot through small gaps in the chain to reach marbles further back. A well-aimed shot can set up a much more valuable match.

- **Aim for Combos:** The key to a high score and clearing levels efficiently is to create combos. When you pop a group of marbles, the chain will temporarily stop. If the two new ends of the chain are the same color, they will attract each other, pull back, and merge, often creating an automatic new match. This is a combo!
