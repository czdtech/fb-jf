### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Story‑driven entry with nightly objectives. You crawl through vents, repair systems, and follow instructions while avoiding Funtime animatronics.

### How to Play
- Follow the terminal’s prompts, but adapt when instructions fail.
- Use audio, shock, and monitoring only when required; conserve actions.
- Later nights remix tasks with higher risk and tighter windows.

### Controls
- Mouse/UI to interact with panels, shocks, and monitors; movement keys for vent sections (host dependent).

### Tips
- Listen carefully—audio cues and flickers telegraph danger.
- Move slowly through dark vent segments; rushing triggers failures.
- Rehearse panel sequences so you can execute under pressure.

### FAQ
- Q: Why do shocks stop working?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Some segments require patience or alternative steps; follow updated prompts.
- Q: Can I skip to specific nights?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Some hosts allow scene/night select; otherwise progress sequentially.
- Q: Is there a custom night mode?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Many versions include a challenge night after the story.
