### Detailed Game Introduction

Cricket Hero is a simple yet addictive arcade-style cricket game where your goal is to score as many runs as possible. As the batsman, you will face a variety of bowlers who will try to get you out. Your job is to watch the ball closely and time your swing to hit the ball and score runs. The game is all about timing and reflexes. Miss the ball or get bowled out, and your turn is over. How many runs can you score to become a true Cricket Hero?

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Watch the Ball:** This is the most fundamental rule of cricket and this game. Keep your eyes glued to the ball from the moment it leaves the bowler's hand.
2.  **Timing is Everything:** The key to scoring big is timing your shot perfectly. Swing too early or too late, and you'll miss the ball. A perfectly timed shot will send the ball flying for a six!
3.  **Anticipate the Bounce:** Pay attention to where the ball is going to pitch. This will help you judge the speed and height of the ball, allowing you to time your swing more effectively.
4.  **Stay Focused:** The game will get progressively faster and more challenging. Maintain your concentration to keep up with the increasing speed and variations in bowling.

### Controls Guide

*   **Swing Bat:** Click the left mouse button or tap the screen to swing your bat. The timing of your click is the only control you have, so make it count!

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
