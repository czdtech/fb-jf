### Detailed Game Introduction

Haru Pandas Slide presents image‑based sliding puzzles. Move tiles along rows/columns to restore adorable panda scenes. Later boards increase tile counts and introduce locked tiles that constrain pathing, rewarding planned sequences over trial‑and‑error.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Frame first: Complete the border to reduce search complexity.
2.  **[DE]** Solve bands: Reassemble distinct color bands (sky/forest/pandas) one at a time.
3.  **[DE]** Three‑move cycles: Use 3‑tile cycles to rotate positions without breaking placed areas.
4.  **[DE]** Lock awareness: Route moves around locked tiles; treat them as anchors.
5.  **[DE]** Minimal moves: Plan ahead to avoid undoing progress.

### Controls Guide

- Drag tiles along permitted axes; undo/reset if supported.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I break my solved area — how to avoid?

A: Use 3‑tile cycles that rotate a subset without touching the completed band.

- Q: Any hint system?

A: Many versions include hints or ghost previews; use sparingly.

- Q: Is there a timer?

A: Often relaxed; some modes track move counts instead.
