### Detailed Game Introduction

Stud Rider emphasizes flow: small throttle pulses, flat landings, and cautious flips maintain speed. Rough terrain punishes nose‑dives and over‑rotation; consistent cadence beats wild stunts.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Land level to keep traction.
2.  **[KO]** Feather throttle over crests; don’t stuff the nose.
3.  **[KO]** Flip sparingly — only with clear arc and altitude.
4.  **[KO]** Pump dips for speed; cut throttle mid‑air to stabilize.
5.  **[KO]** Memorize jump lengths for perfect linkups.

### Controls Guide

- Throttle/Brake: W/S or Up/Down; Lean: A/D or Left/Right; Restart via UI.
