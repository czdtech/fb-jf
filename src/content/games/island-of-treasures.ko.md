### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Collect Everything:** Your primary goal is to collect coins, jewels, and other treasures scattered along your path. These contribute to your score and can be used to unlock upgrades or new characters.
2.  **[KO]** **Master the Moves:** You'll need to quickly react to obstacles. Swipe left/right to change lanes, swipe up to jump over gaps and low obstacles, and swipe down to slide under high obstacles. Practice these moves to make them second nature.
3.  **[KO]** **Utilize Power-ups:** Keep an eye out for power-ups like speed boosts, shields, or magnets. These temporary advantages can help you survive longer and collect more treasure. Use them strategically, especially in challenging sections.
4.  **[KO]** **Avoid Collisions:** Hitting any obstacle or rival pirate will end your run. Always prioritize dodging over collecting if a collision is imminent.
