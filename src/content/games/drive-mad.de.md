### Overview
Physics obstacle driving: keep your truck upright across seesaws, bridges, and traps. Levels escalate with moving parts and brittle platforms.

### How to Play
- Control speed and weight shift to keep traction over gaps and ramps.
- Reverse to steady the chassis before big drops or steep climbs.
- Some stages require controlled flips to land wheels‑down.

### Controls
- Arrow/WASD: drive/reverse/tilt; R: restart; Esc/P: pause (host dependent).

### Tips
- Feather throttle; full‑gas often flips the truck.
- Use reverse mid‑air to tip the nose up or down.
- Memorize trap timing; patience beats brute speed.

### FAQ
- Q: Are cars different?
A: Some packs change vehicle weight/length, altering balance.
- Q: Can I skip hard levels?
A: Certain hosts allow level select; otherwise master timing and tilt control.
- Q: Why break on bridges?
A: Excess speed compresses suspension and bounces you off.
