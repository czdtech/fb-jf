### Detailed Game Introduction

Nature Strikes Back is a unique and engaging game that combines the addictive puzzle mechanics of a merge game with the strategic depth of tower defense. In this game, you are tasked with protecting the Heart of Nature from an invasion of polluting monsters known as Mucklings. To do this, you will summon and merge various Guardian Spirits, evolving them into more powerful forms and deploying them on the battlefield to automatically fend off the relentless waves of enemies.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Summon and Merge:** The core gameplay revolves around creating powerful defenders. Use your energy to summon basic Guardian Spirits onto your merge board. Drag and drop one Spirit onto an identical one to merge them into a single, higher-level Spirit with improved attack power.
2.  **[KO]** **Deploy Your Guardians:** You have a limited number of slots on the battlefield. Drag your most powerful Spirits from the merge board into these slots. Once deployed, they will automatically attack any Mucklings that come into their range.
3.  **[KO]** **Focus on High-Level Merges:** It is much more effective to have a few high-level Guardians than a large number of weak ones. Continuously summon and merge to create the strongest possible defenders for your front line.
4.  **[KO]** **Strategic Placement:** Place your strongest Guardians in positions where they can cover the longest stretch of the enemy path, such as near corners and curves. Place area-of-effect or slowing Guardians where they can affect the most enemies at once.

### Controls Guide

*   **[KO]** **Summon Spirit:** Click the "Summon" button to get a new base-level Guardian Spirit.
*   **[KO]** **Merge Spirits:** Click and drag a Spirit onto another identical Spirit to combine them.
*   **[KO]** **Deploy/Move:** Drag a Spirit from your merge board to an empty slot on the battlefield. You can also move already placed Spirits between different slots.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[KO]** **Q: How do I get stronger Guardians?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** By merging. Combine two identical Guardians to create one Guardian of the next tier (e.g., two Level 2 Guardians merge into one Level 3 Guardian).

*   **[KO]** **Q: What happens if a monster reaches the end of the path?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** If an enemy reaches the Heart of Nature at the end of the path, you will lose one life or health point. If your health reaches zero, you lose the level.

*   **[KO]** **Q: Should I fill all my deployment slots quickly?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** Not necessarily. It's often better to focus on merging to create one or two very powerful Guardians first, rather than deploying many weak ones. A single high-level Guardian can often do more damage than several low-level ones combined.
