### Présentation du jeu

*Incredibox XRun Simulator* combine esthétique futuriste et gameplay en grille de la série Simulator. Tu cliques sur des icônes pour activer des **beats rapides, basses électroniques et FX de course futuriste**, comme si tu composais la bande‑son d’un jeu runner.


As players layer more sounds, a progress bar at the top of the screen fills up, guiding them towards discovering the mod's hidden audio-visual bonuses. The experience is less about individual performers and more about the direct, hands-on creation of a complex electronic beat.

The gameplay departs from the official Incredibox series, utilizing the signature **grid-based interface** of the Simulator mods. Instead of dragging icons onto characters, players are presented with a grid of 20 sound icons. The objective is to create an intense musical loop by clicking these icons to activate or deactivate them.
### Stratégies de jeu et conseils

1.  **Prépare un rythme rapide**  
    Active plusieurs pistes de drums pour un tempo nerveux qui rappelle une course.

    - **Ajoute des basses et FX de mouvement**  
    Sons de boost, whooshes, montées synthé… ils donnent la sensation de vitesse.

    - **Crée des sections**  

    - **Experiment with Layers**: Don't be afraid to click many icons at once. The beauty of the simulator format is the ability to create dense, complex soundscapes. However, also learn which sounds are best used sparingly to punctuate the track.

    - **Create a Build-Up and Drop**: The essence of EDM is the energy shift. Use riser effects and filter sweeps to build tension. Then, unleash your main synth lead or a heavy bassline to create a satisfying "drop." You can simulate this by activating and deactivating different icons in sequence.

- **Build the Beat, Then the Bass**: A classic production technique is to start with your drums. Activate a kick and snare pattern first. Then, add a powerful bassline that complements the rhythm.

- **Synths/Leads**: These are the main melodic hooks. They can be aggressive "wobble" basses from dubstep, catchy synth melodies, or vocal chops.

- **Effects/Risers**: These icons provide atmospheric sounds, risers (sounds that build in pitch and intensity), and other effects that create tension and release.
    Joue avec les activations/désactivations pour simuler départ, montée en vitesse, puis sprint final.
