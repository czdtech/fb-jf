### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Ghost Pro Racing emphasizes hot‑lap consistency against ghost replays. You’ll learn braking points, apex speeds, and throttle pickups while ghost cars show faster lines. Clean inputs and repeatable references beat risky dive‑bombs for stable PBs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
