### Detailed Game Introduction
4.  **Conserve 移動するs:** Each level has a limited number of moves. Don't waste them on small, insignificant matches. Try to set up large matches that will create boosters or cause large cascades.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Fruit Cube Blast is a vibrant and explosive "tap-to-blast" puzzle game. Unlike match-3 games where you swap items, in this game, you tap on groups of two or more adjacent, identical fruit cubes to blast them off the board. The goal is to complete level-specific objectives by strategically clearing cubes and creating powerful combos. By blasting larger groups of cubes, you can create special boosters like rockets and bombs to clear even more of the level in spectacular fashion.
The controls are extremely simple.（日本語訳が必要）

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

- **Q: Why can't I tap on a single cube?**（日本語訳が必要）
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Bigger is Better:** Always look for the largest possible group of matching cubes to tap. Tapping a small group of 2 or 3 is less efficient. Larger groups not only clear more space but are also the only way to create powerful boosters.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Create and Combine Boosters:** This is the core strategy for winning difficult levels.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Rocket:** Tap a group of 5-6 cubes to create a Rocket, which clears a full row or column.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Bomb:** Tap a group of 7-8 cubes to create a Bomb, which clears a 3x3 area.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Color Wheel:** Tap a group of 9 or more cubes to create a Color Wheel, which clears all cubes of a single color.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Combine:** The real power comes from activating two boosters next to each other. For example, a Rocket + Bomb combo clears a huge area.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Plan for Objectives:** Pay attention to the goal. If you need to collect 30 red cubes, focus on matching red cubes. If you need to drop an item to the bottom, focus on clearing the cubes directly beneath it.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Conserve Moves:** Each level has a limited number of moves. Don't waste them on small, insignificant matches. Try to set up large matches that will create boosters or cause large cascades.
