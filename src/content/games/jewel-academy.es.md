### Detailed Game Introduction

Jewel Academy is a rich and polished match-3 puzzle game that invites players to a world of colorful gems and magical challenges. As a student of the academy, you will progress through a vast map of levels, each with a unique objective. The core gameplay involves swapping adjacent jewels to create lines of three or more of the same color. By making strategic matches, you can create powerful special gems, overcome tricky obstacles, and solve hundreds of engaging puzzles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Look for Special Combos:** Don't just settle for matching three. Actively look for opportunities to match four or five jewels, as this is the key to creating powerful power-ups that can clear large sections of the board.
2.  **[ES]** **Combine Power-ups:** The most effective way to clear difficult levels is by combining special jewels. For example, swapping an Arrow jewel with a Bomb jewel will clear three rows and three columns simultaneously. Swapping two Color Bombs together will clear the entire board!
3.  **[ES]** **Focus on the Objective:** Always keep the level's goal in mind. If you need to clear certain blocked tiles, focus your matches in those areas. If you need to drop special items to the bottom, clear the jewels underneath them. Don't waste moves on matches that don't contribute to your goal.
4.  **[ES]** **Work from the Bottom:** When possible, make matches near the bottom of the board. This causes more jewels to fall from the top, increasing the chances of creating automatic chain reactions or cascades, which can help you complete objectives without using extra moves.

### Controls Guide

The game is played using a mouse or touch screen.

*   **[ES]** **Swap Jewels:** Click on a jewel, then click on an adjacent jewel to swap their positions. Alternatively, you can click and drag a jewel to an adjacent spot. A swap is only valid if it results in a match of three or more.
*   **[ES]** **Activate Power-ups:** Swap a special jewel just like any other jewel to activate its effect. To combine power-ups, swap two adjacent special jewels with each other.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[ES]** **Q: How do I create a Bomb?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** You create a Bomb by matching five jewels in an "L" or "T" shape. Bombs explode and clear a 3x3 area of jewels around them.

*   **[ES]** **Q: What does the rainbow-colored jewel do?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** That is a Color Bomb, created by matching five jewels in a straight line (horizontal or vertical). Swap it with any adjacent jewel, and it will remove all jewels of that color from the entire board.

*   **[ES]** **Q: Why did I run out of moves?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** Many levels in Jewel Academy are move-limited. You must complete the specific level objective before you use up all your allotted moves. If you fail to do so, you will have to use a life to try again.
