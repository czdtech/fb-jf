### Detailed Game Introduction

Puzzle Pieces is a tidy shape‑fitting puzzler. Drag and rotate polyforms to fill boards exactly, managing limited space and piece orientations as layouts grow more intricate.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with anchors: Place unique or large shapes first to reduce ambiguity.
2.  Edge framing: Build clean borders to reveal interior gaps.
3.  Look for parity: Match protrusions and cavities; avoid leaving single‑cell holes.
4.  Rotate liberally: Check all orientations; many fits appear only after rotation.
5.  Undo freely: Backtrack early instead of forcing a bad fit.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to move pieces; rotate via click/tap or a rotate button.
- Undo/Reset: Fix mistakes quickly; no penalty in most modes.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- A piece never fits—bug? Usually orientation; try other rotations or reframe edges.
- Timers? Varies; most modes are relaxed.
- Hints? Many versions include hints; use sparingly to preserve challenge.
