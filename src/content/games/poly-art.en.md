### Detailed Game Introduction

Poly Art (also known as Poly Puzzle) is a visually stunning and mentally relaxing 3D puzzle game. Each level begins with what appears to be a chaotic jumble of colorful, low-poly shards. The challenge is to rotate this cluster of polygons in 3D space to find the one specific angle at which the scattered pieces align perfectly, revealing a beautiful and recognizable piece of art, such as an animal, an object, or a character. It's a game of perception, patience, and discovery.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Rotate Slowly and Steadily:** Don't just swipe wildly. Rotate the puzzle slowly in one direction (e.g., horizontally) to see if any recognizable shapes begin to form. If you see a hint of a shape, continue rotating carefully around that axis.
2.  **Look for Outlines:** As you get close to the solution, you will start to see the outline of the final image. Focus on these emerging lines and adjust the rotation slightly to bring them into sharp focus.
3.  **Use All Axes:** Remember that you can rotate the puzzle horizontally and vertically. If you get stuck rotating on one axis, try a completely different direction. Sometimes the solution is at an unexpected angle.
4.  **Relax and Enjoy:** Poly Art is not a game about speed. It is designed to be a calming and satisfying experience. Take your time, enjoy the colors and shapes, and savor the moment of discovery when the image finally clicks into place.

### Controls Guide

The controls are minimalistic and intuitive.

*   **Rotate Puzzle (Desktop):** Click and hold the left mouse button, then drag the mouse left, right, up, or down to rotate the cluster of polygons.
*   **Rotate Puzzle (Mobile):** Swipe your finger across the screen in any direction to rotate the puzzle.
