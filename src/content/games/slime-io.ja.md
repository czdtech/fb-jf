### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Slime.io is a chaotic and satisfying 3D arcade game that belongs to the popular ".io" genre of multiplayer games. You control a small slime in a bustling city with one simple goal: become the biggest. You do this by sliding around the map and absorbing everything in your path that is smaller than you—from streetlights and cars to entire buildings. Compete against other players, absorb the smaller ones, and avoid being eaten by the giants to dominate the leaderboard before the timer runs out!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
