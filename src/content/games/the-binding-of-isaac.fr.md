Yes, The Binding of Isaac is known for its high difficulty and steep learning curve. Success often depends on understanding item synergies and enemy patterns, as well as a bit of luck with item drops.

**Is the game difficult?**

New characters, items, and challenges are unlocked by completing specific achievements, defeating bosses, or reaching certain milestones within the game.

**How do I unlock new characters and items?**

A roguelike is a subgenre of RPGs characterized by procedurally generated levels, turn-based gameplay (though Isaac is real-time), tile-based graphics (Isaac is top-down 2D), and permanent death, meaning when your character dies, you lose all progress and start a new game.
