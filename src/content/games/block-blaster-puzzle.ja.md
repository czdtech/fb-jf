### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Block Blaster Puzzle is a clean, session‑friendly block‑placement game. You’re given sets of pieces to fit onto a grid; completing rows or regions clears space. Success relies on shaping the board to accept awkward pieces later, staging multi‑line clears, and avoiding sealed cavities that cannot be filled.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Edge hygiene: Keep borders smooth to reduce isolated single cells.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Reserve sockets: Leave a few 2×2 or 3‑cell pockets for common awkward pieces.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Multi‑line setups: Build toward double/triple clears to refresh space quickly.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Avoid tall wells: Don’t dig narrow vertical shafts you can’t fill later.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Piece triage: Place the hardest piece first when the board gets crowded.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 6.  Use previews: If next pieces are visible, plan sequences instead of single moves.

### Controls Guide

- Drag shapes onto the grid; rotate if supported by tapping or a rotate button.
- Undo/Reset are helpful for greedy placements gone wrong.
