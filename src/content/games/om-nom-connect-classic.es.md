### Detailed Game Introduction

Om Nom Connect Classic is a fun and fast-paced tile-matching puzzle game featuring the adorable characters from the Cut the Rope universe. The goal is to clear the board by finding and connecting pairs of identical tiles. The challenge lies in the connection rule: a pair can only be removed if the path between them has no more than two 90-degree turns. With a timer counting down, you'll need to be quick and strategic to complete each level.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **The Connection Rule:** You can only match two identical tiles if you can draw a line between them with a maximum of two bends (L-shape or Z/U-shape). The path must also be clear of any other tiles.
2.  **[ES]** **Scan the Edges:** The easiest matches are often on the outside of the grid. Start by quickly scanning the perimeter for adjacent pairs or those that can be connected with a straight line.
3.  **[ES]** **Think Ahead:** Every pair you remove opens up new possibilities. Try to make matches that will clear a path to other potential pairs, especially those trapped in the center of the board.
4.  **[ES]** **Use Hints and Shuffles:** If you get stuck, use a hint to reveal a valid pair. If you completely run out of moves, use the shuffle button to rearrange all the tiles on the board and create new matching opportunities.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple clicks or taps.

*   **[ES]** **Select Tiles:** Click on a tile to select it, then click on its identical partner. If the connection is valid according to the rules, the pair will be removed.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[ES]** **Q: Why can't I connect two identical tiles?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** The path between them is either blocked by another tile, or the path would require more than two 90-degree turns.

*   **[ES]** **Q: What happens if the timer runs out?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** You will fail the level and have to start over. Speed and quick recognition are key!

*   **[ES]** **Q: What's the best strategy for finding matches quickly?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** Don't fixate on one tile for too long. Keep your eyes moving and scan the entire board. Sometimes the most obvious pairs are the ones you overlook when you're too focused on a specific area.
