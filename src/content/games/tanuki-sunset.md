### Game Introduction

Tanuki Sunset is a third-person longboarding game where you play as a raccoon named Tanuki, skating down a beautiful, synthwave-inspired coastal mountain range. The game focuses on stylish, flow-based gameplay, rewarding players for performing smooth drifts, big jumps, and near-misses with traffic.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Collecting:** Grab the yellow "Tanuki Bits" to fill your Bonus Roulette meter, which gives you a spin for a massive point bonus.
- **Near Misses:** Skate dangerously close to cars and other obstacles to get "near miss" points.

- **Drift:** `Spacebar`
- **180 Slide / Slow Down:** `S` or `Down Arrow Key`
- **Speed Stance:** `W` or `Up Arrow Key` (Hold to break through certain obstacles)

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How do I get a high score?**

The key to a high score is to link long, continuous drifts together. Try to drift around every corner and perform tricks off every ramp. Collecting all the Tanuki Bits to get a bonus spin is also crucial.

When you collect enough Tanuki Bits, a roulette wheel spins at the top of the screen. If it lands on a jackpot, you'll receive a huge number of bonus points.

**Can I customize my raccoon?**

Yes, by earning points and completing objectives, you can unlock new clothing items and longboard parts to customize Tanuki's look.
