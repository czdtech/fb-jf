### Detailed Game Introduction

Onet Connect Classic is a fast-paced and addictive tile-matching puzzle game, often referred to as a "link-up" game. The objective is to clear a board filled with colorful tiles (often featuring animals, fruits, or other cute icons) by finding and connecting pairs of identical tiles. Unlike Mahjong Solitaire, the challenge comes from the connection rules and a ticking clock, requiring both sharp eyes and quick thinking to clear the board before time expires.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Connection Rule:** This is the most important concept. You can only remove a pair of identical tiles if the path between them is clear and can be drawn with a line that has **no more than two 90-degree turns**. This means the path can be:
    *   A straight line (zero turns).
    *   An "L" shape (one turn).
    *   A "Z" or "U" shape (two turns).

2.  **Scan the Edges First:** The easiest matches to spot are usually around the perimeter of the board, as they have more open space around them. Start by scanning the edges for adjacent pairs or pairs that can be connected with a simple straight line.
3.  **Think Ahead:** When you clear a pair, it opens up new paths for other tiles. Try to make matches that will free up the most critical areas of the board, rather than just the first pair you see.
4.  **Use Your Tools:** Don't be afraid to use hints and shuffles when you get stuck.
    *   **Hints:** The hint button will show you one possible valid match.
    *   **Shuffles:** If you run out of possible moves, the shuffle button will rearrange all the remaining tiles on the board, creating new opportunities.
5.  **Race the Clock:** Each level is timed. Keep an eye on the timer and try to maintain a steady pace of matching to avoid running out of time.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:onet-connect-classic:q-why-cant-i-connect-c548c2f6 -->
  **Q: Why can't I connect two identical tiles?**
    *   **A:** There are two possible reasons: 1) The path between them is blocked by another tile, or 2) The path required to connect them would need more than two 90-degree turns.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:onet-connect-classic:q-what-happens-when-i-d9559b94 -->
  **Q: What happens when I run out of time?**
    *   **A:** If the timer reaches zero before you have cleared all the tiles, you lose the level and will have to start over.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:onet-connect-classic:q-is-there-a-penalty-2dc7b42f -->
  **Q: Is there a penalty for using hints?**
    *   **A:** Usually, no, but you have a limited number of them. Use them when you are truly stuck to save valuable time.
