### Présentation

Tap Tap Shots est un jeu d’arcade minimaliste : chaque pression fait rebondir
la balle, à toi de caler le timing pour qu’elle tombe dans le panier.

### Conseils

- enchaîne les paniers pour activer la balle « en feu » et augmenter le score ;
- vise les tirs propres (sans toucher l’arceau) pour des points bonus ;
- garde un rythme régulier plutôt que de spammer.




- **Timer:** After each successful shot, the timer resets, but if you miss, the game is over.

- **Combos:** Scoring consecutive baskets will set the ball on fire, which activates a score multiplier for bonus points. Clean shots that don't touch the rim also award extra points.
It's all about timing. Try to tap just as the ball reaches the peak of its bounce or starts to descend. This often gives you the most control for aiming at the hoop.

**Is there a trick to aiming?**

When the ball is on fire, you are in a combo streak. Every basket you score while the ball is on fire will be worth more points.

**What happens when the ball is on fire?**

Focus on finding a consistent rhythm. Don't rush your shots. Aim for "clean" shots (not touching the rim) to get bonus points and try to build up a combo to set the ball on fire for a score multiplier.

**How do I get a high score?**
