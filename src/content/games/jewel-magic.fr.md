### Présentation

Un match‑3 plus générique, avec de nombreux niveaux, des obstacles progressifs (glace, chaînes, etc.) et une panoplie de boosters à déclencher via des alignements avancés.



    - **A:** If you don't complete the level's objective before your moves run out, you will lose a life and must restart the level.

- **Q: What happens when I run out of moves?**

    - **A:** Create as many special jewels and combos as possible. Triggering long chain reactions and clearing a large number of jewels in a single move will result in a much higher score.

- **Q: What is the best way to get a high score?**

    - **A:** You must make a match that includes the frozen or chained jewel. This will break the ice or the chain, freeing the jewel to be used in future matches.

- **Q: How do I get past levels with frozen or chained jewels?**

### Foire aux questions (FAQ)

- **Swap Jewels:** Click and drag a jewel to swap it with an adjacent one. The swap will only complete if it forms a valid match of three or more identical jewels.


    - **Start from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the grid increases the chance of causing a cascade, where new jewels fall into place and create automatic matches. This can help you clear the board and reach your goal much faster.

    - **Focus on the Goal:** Each level has a specific objective, such as reaching a target score, clearing all the jelly from behind the jewels, or dropping special items to the bottom. Always focus your efforts on achieving that goal within the limited number of moves.

    - **Combine for Power:** The ultimate strategy is to combine two special jewels. Swapping a bomb and a lightning jewel, for instance, creates a massive cross-shaped blast. Experiment with different combinations to see their powerful effects.

- **Rainbow Jewel:** Match 5 jewels in a straight line to create a powerful rainbow jewel. Swap it with any adjacent jewel to remove all jewels of that color from the board.

- **Bomb Jewel:** Match 5 jewels in an L or T shape to create a bomb that explodes and destroys a block of surrounding jewels.

- **Lightning Jewel:** Match 4 jewels in a line to create a jewel that can clear an entire row or column.
The game is controlled using simple mouse or touch gestures.
