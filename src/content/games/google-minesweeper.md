### Overview
Minesweeper reveals numbers showing how many mines touch a cell. Use these clues to mark mines with flags and open safe cells, aiming to clear the board without detonating. Difficulty scales grid size and mine count.

### How to Play
- Left‑click opens a cell; right‑click toggles a flag; chord/open around a number when flags match counts (host dependent).
- Use basic inferences (1‑1 pairs, 1‑2 patterns) to expand safely.
- On large boards, isolate corners/edges to reduce branching.

### Controls
- Mouse/touch; optional chording and quick‑open shortcuts vary by host.

### Tips
- Keep a consistent marking convention to avoid misflags.
- When forced to guess, choose tiles that reveal the most info if wrong.
- Edges often constrain layouts—scan along borders for sure moves.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I avoid guessing in Minesweeper?  
  A: Use pattern sets and parity checks; some positions remain 50/50.
- Q: What does the number on a cell indicate?  
  A: It equals the count of adjacent mines among the eight neighbors.
- Q: Does difficulty only change board size?  
  A: It changes both size and mine density.
