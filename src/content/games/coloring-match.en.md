### Detailed Game Introduction

Coloring Match asks you to reproduce a target color by mixing primaries and adjusting brightness/saturation. Subtle differences matter: overshooting saturation or value can miss the goal even if the hue matches.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Match hue first (color wheel), then adjust saturation and value.
2.  Make small changes near the target; big swings overshoot.
3.  Compare under the same lighting/background if the UI offers it.
4.  Use undo/reset when the mix gets muddy.
5.  Learn complementary pairs to neutralize tints.

### Controls Guide

- Drag sliders or mix paint amounts; preview updates live.
- Confirm when your color matches the target within tolerance.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Hue matches but still fails — why?
  
  A: Saturation or value is off. Lower saturation to gray it out or raise value for brightness.

- Q: Any shortcut for brown/gray?
  
  A: Mix complementary colors to neutralize toward brown/gray, then adjust value.

- Q: Do tiny tweaks matter?
  
  A: Yes — near the goal, use small slider nudges for precision.
