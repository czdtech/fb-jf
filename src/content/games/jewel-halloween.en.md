### Detailed Game Introduction

Jewel Halloween is a seasonal match‑3. Swap adjacent gems to make lines of three or more, spawn power gems, and complete targets like score thresholds, limited moves, or clearing obstacles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Work from bottom to trigger cascades.
2.  Prioritize objectives (e.g., blockers) over raw scoring.
3.  Combine power gems for board‑wide clears.
4.  Plan two moves ahead to avoid isolating colors.
5.  Save strong combos for tight goals.

### Controls Guide

- Swap: Drag adjacent gems to swap.
- Power‑ups: Activate by matching or tapping per rules.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Stuck on move limits? Focus on blockers and cascades rather than small matches.

- Hints available? Often yes; use sparingly.
