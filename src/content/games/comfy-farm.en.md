### Detailed Game Introduction

Comfy Farm is a charming and relaxing farming simulation game where you get to build and manage your own virtual farm. The goal is to transform a small plot of land into a thriving agricultural enterprise. You'll plant seeds, water your crops, harvest them for profit, and protect them from pests. Use your earnings to buy new seeds and valuable upgrades to automate and expand your comfy farm.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Farming Cycle:** The core of the game is the planting and harvesting cycle. Click on an empty plot to prepare it, plant a seed, and then water it. After a set amount of time, the crop will be ready to harvest, earning you money.
2.  **Pest Patrol:** Be vigilant! Pests like crows and flies will periodically appear and try to eat your crops. You must quickly click on them to scare them away before they damage your harvest.
3.  **Invest in Upgrades:** Reinvest your profits wisely. Upgrades are key to growing your farm. Buying a sprinkler will automate watering, and a scarecrow will help deter pests, freeing you up to manage a larger farm.
4.  **Expand Your Land:** As you earn more money, you can purchase new plots of land. Expanding your farm allows you to plant more crops simultaneously, dramatically increasing your income potential.
