<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Diner Dash is a time‑management game about seating guests, taking orders, delivering food, bussing tables, and keeping customer hearts high to clear objectives. You earn combos by chaining actions (e.g., seating groups of the same color, serving quickly) and buy upgrades between levels. 

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Seat arriving customers promptly; match table sizes and colors when possible for bonuses.  
- Take orders, deliver dishes, and clear tables in an efficient loop to avoid queues.  
- Use upgrades (faster shoes, more tables, equipment) to meet higher quotas. 

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Mouse/touch: click destinations in order to queue actions; some versions allow drag‑and‑drop for seating or serving. 

### Tips and Strategies
- Chain related actions back‑to‑back to maintain high combos.  
- Prioritize impatient customers first; watch the hearts meter.  
- Pre‑stage actions (collect orders in a sweep, then serve in a sweep) to minimize travel.
