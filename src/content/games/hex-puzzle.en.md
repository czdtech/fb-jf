### Detailed Game Introduction

Hex Puzzle is a fun and engaging twist on the classic block puzzle genre, played on a hexagonal grid. The objective is to place various shapes, made of hexagonal blocks, onto the board to create complete, unbroken lines of hexes. Lines can be formed in three directions: horizontally and in both diagonal directions. When a line is complete, it clears from the board, freeing up space and earning you points. With no time limits, it’s a test of pure strategy and spatial planning.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Think in Three Directions:** Unlike a square grid, a hexagonal grid allows you to form lines in three different directions. Always be scanning the board not just for horizontal lines, but for diagonal opportunities as well.
2.  **Don't Isolate Spaces:** Try to keep your placements compact. Leaving single empty hexes scattered around the board can make it very difficult to place larger pieces later in the game.
3.  **Plan for Your Pieces:** You are given three pieces at a time. Before placing one, quickly assess if there is room for the other two. It's a common mistake to place one piece only to find that you have blocked yourself from placing the next one.
4.  **Combos are Key:** Clearing multiple lines with a single piece placement will award you a combo score bonus. Look for placements that can complete two or even three lines simultaneously for a huge score boost.

### Controls Guide

The game is controlled with a simple `drag`-and-`drop` interface.

*   **Place Blocks:** Use your `mouse` or finger to `drag` a shape from your inventory at the bottom and place it onto an empty `space` on the hexagonal grid.
