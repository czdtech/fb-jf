### Detailed Game Introduction

Futoshiki ("not equal") is a Latin‑square logic puzzle like Sudoku but with inequality signs (>, <) between neighboring cells. You must place digits so each row/column contains all numbers exactly once and every inequality is satisfied. The signs create strong chains that power elegant deductions.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Inequality chains: A>B>C means A≥C+2; pencil candidates accordingly.
2.  **[KO]** Extremes: A>…>B bounds A high and B low; use 1/Max eliminations on chain ends.
3.  **[KO]** Row/column scans: Apply Latin constraints to prune candidates aggressively.
4.  **[KO]** Contradiction loops: Assume a value on tight cells; backtrack if an inequality breaks or row/col duplicates.
5.  **[KO]** Symmetry: Balanced puzzles often have mirrored inequality structures — exploit them.

### Controls Guide

- Tap a cell to enter candidates/values; toggle pencil mode; undo/redo.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I can’t progress — any tip?

A: Expand inequality chains into explicit bounds (e.g., if 5>□>3 then middle ∈ {4}); combine with row/col hits.

- Q: Are guesses required?

A: Good sets are solvable logically; at worst use controlled assumptions with quick backtrack.

- Q: Difference vs Sudoku?

A: Inequalities add directed constraints, enabling stronger forced moves.
