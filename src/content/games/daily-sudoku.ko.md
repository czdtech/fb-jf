### Overview
Daily Sudoku offers a fresh 9×9 logic puzzle each day. Fill digits 1–9 so that each row, column, and 3×3 box contains all numbers without repetition. Many hosts provide multiple difficulties, pencil marks, and validation tools.

### How to Play
- Select a cell and type a digit; use pencil marks (notes) to track candidates.
- Apply basic techniques such as singles, hidden singles, and elimination by scanning peers.
- On higher difficulties, learn advanced patterns (pairs, X‑Wing, etc.).

### Controls
- Number keys to enter digits; Shift/Right‑click toggles pencil marks (site‑dependent); Undo/Redo and Check tools are common.

### Tips and Strategies
- Start with singles found by scanning each row/column/box.
- Use notes consistently and clear them after placing a number.
- Avoid guesswork; if the host allows, use error‑highlighting conservatively.
