### Overview
Interactive face‑stretching toy: grab and drag a rubbery face, then watch it wobble back with springy skin‑simulation.

### How to Play
- Drag, poke, pinch, and release different spots to see varied deformations.
- Some hosts include “squish” strength or resolution toggles.

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch drag and release; settings panel where available.

### Tips
- Pull from cheeks/forehead for broad wobbles; small pinches create fast ripples.
- Lower resolution on slower devices for smoother motion.
- Shorter, repeated pulls keep the jello‑like jiggle going.
