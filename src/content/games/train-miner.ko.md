### Detailed Game Introduction

Train Miner asks you to place track pieces so a mine‑train collects resources and exits safely. Turns cost momentum/fuel; mis‑routes cause dead‑ends. Smart layouts collect extras without trapping the train.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Exit first: Ensure a viable exit path before optional ore.
2.  **[KO]** Turn economy: Prefer straights; reserve turns for mandatory bends.
3.  **[KO]** Branch spurs: Add short spurs to grab side ore and rejoin main line.
4.  **[KO]** Test rides: Simulate routes mentally before launching.
5.  **[KO]** Undo quickly after dead‑end sightings.

### Controls Guide

- Place/rotate track pieces; launch train; pause/retry via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I dead‑end near the exit.

A: You spent turns earlier; reroute straighter segments.

- Q: Can I collect everything?

A: Often yes with smart spurs; prioritize safety first.
