### Detailed Game Introduction

He Likes The Darkness is a minimalist, high‑contrast platformer. Low visibility, moving traps, and collectible orbs define compact stages. Mastering hop length, short stalls, and momentum preservation produces clean clears with satisfying flow.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Light scouting: Use small hops to reveal platform edges without overcommitting.
2.  **[DE]** Cycle timing: Observe moving hazards (saws/spikes) for a full cycle, then commit.
3.  **[DE]** Momentum: Keep micro‑momentum through tap‑taps rather than full stops.
4.  **[DE]** Orb routing: Grab orbs on safe passes; don’t force risky backtracks.
5.  **[DE]** Retry rhythm: Fast restarts build muscle memory for tricky segments.

### Controls Guide

- Move/Jump: Arrows/WASD + Space; occasional double‑jump per level rules.
