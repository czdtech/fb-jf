### Detailed Game Introduction

Bricks Breaker Crush fires barrages of balls that ricochet through numbered bricks. Your aim sets the initial trajectory; bricks count down as they’re hit. Mastery is about shaping long ricochet paths, multiplying contacts per volley, and preventing walls from reaching the bottom.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Shallow angles: Start at modest angles to maximize side‑to‑side hits.
2.  Target multipliers: Hit +ball pickups early to scale your volleys.
3.  Cut columns: Remove high‑value columns that threaten the bottom.
4.  Set traps: Build V‑shaped lanes so balls loop near the top for extended time on target.
5.  Emergency clears: When a row is critical, aim direct shots to neutralize it before it drops.
6.  Power‑ups: Save line clears for emergencies; chain with big volleys when possible.
