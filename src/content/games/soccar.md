### Game Introduction

SocCar is an exciting hybrid sports game that blends the high-speed action of driving with the classic objective of soccer. Players control a car on a large field and compete to hit a giant ball into the opponent's goal. It's a game of fast reflexes, strategic positioning, and powerful boosts.

### Gameplay Guide

The main goal is to score more goals than your opponent before time runs out. Work with your teammate (if in 2v2 mode) to outmaneuver the other team. Use your car to "dribble" the ball down the field or hit it with force for a powerful shot. Control of the ball is key, as is knowing when to attack and when to fall back and defend your goal.

### Controls Guide

- **Movement:** Use `WASD` or `Arrow Keys` to drive your car around the field.
- **Boost/Dash:** Press `Shift` or `Spacebar` to get a burst of speed. This is crucial for reaching the ball first or making a quick save.
- **Jump:** Use the `Right Mouse Button` or a dedicated key to make your car jump, which is useful for aerial hits.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is the objective of SocCar?**

The objective is to use your car to hit the ball into the opposing team's goal, scoring more points than them within the time limit.

**Is there a good strategy for winning?**

Teamwork and positioning are critical. Don't have all players chase the ball at once. Instead, have one player attack the ball while others position themselves for a pass, a rebound, or to defend the goal. Managing your boost effectively is also essential for success.

**How is this different from regular soccer?**

In SocCar, you are a car! This means you can use high speeds, boosts, and jumps to interact with the ball in ways that are impossible in traditional soccer, leading to explosive and dynamic gameplay.
