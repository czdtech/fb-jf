### Detailed Game Introduction

Cake Smash is a vibrant and engaging match-3 puzzle game. The objective is to swap adjacent cakes to create lines of three or more identical cakes, which then get "smashed" and removed from the board, with new cakes falling into place. Each level has a specific goal, such as reaching a certain score or clearing a certain number of a specific type of cake.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Identify Matches:** Look for opportunities to match three or more identical cakes by swapping two adjacent cakes.
2.  **Create Special Cakes:** Matching four or five cakes at once will often create a special cake with powerful clearing abilities. For example, a striped cake might clear a whole row or column.
3.  **Combine Special Cakes:** For even bigger effects, try to swap two special cakes with each other.
4.  **Focus on the Objective:** Pay attention to the level's goal. Sometimes you need to focus on clearing specific tiles or reaching a score target within a limited number of moves.

### Controls Guide

*   **Mouse/Touch:** Use the mouse or touch screen to click and drag or tap on adjacent cakes to swap them.
