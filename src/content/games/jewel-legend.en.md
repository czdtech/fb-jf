### Detailed Game Introduction

Jewel Legend is a vibrant and highly addictive match-3 puzzle game set in a world filled with precious gems. Players embark on an epic adventure across hundreds of levels, solving puzzles by swapping and matching three or more jewels of the same color. The game is known for its colorful graphics, satisfying chain reactions, and a wide variety of level objectives that keep the gameplay fresh and engaging. Creating special gems through clever matches is crucial to overcoming the game's most difficult challenges.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Create Special Gems:** The key to success is to think beyond simple match-3s. Always be on the lookout for opportunities to create powerful special gems:
    *   **Match 4 Gems:** Creates a Lightning Jewel that clears an entire row or column.
    *   **Match 5 Gems (L or T Shape):** Creates a Bomb Jewel that explodes, destroying all surrounding gems.
    *   **Match 5 Gems (in a line):** Creates a powerful Color Jewel that can clear all gems of a single color from the board.

2.  **Combine Boosters for Maximum Impact:** Don't just use your special gems; combine them! Swapping two special gems next to each other results in a massive board-clearing effect. For example, swapping a Bomb with a Lightning Jewel clears three rows/columns, and swapping two Color Jewels clears every single gem on the board.

3.  **Plan Your Moves:** You only have a limited number of moves for each level. Before making a swap, look at the entire board and the level objective. Prioritize matches that will help you achieve the goal, such as breaking frozen tiles or dropping special items.

4.  **Anticipate Cascades:** Making matches at the bottom of the board is often a good strategy. This allows a large number of new gems to fall into place, increasing the chance of setting off a chain reaction (cascade) of automatic matches, which can clear a large portion of the board without using any extra moves.

### Controls Guide

The game is controlled with simple touch or `mouse` gestures.

*   **Swap Jewels:** `Click` and `drag` a jewel to an adjacent spot to swap it with the jewel there. You can also `click` the first jewel and then `click` the adjacent one you want to swap with. The swap will only be successful if it creates a match.
