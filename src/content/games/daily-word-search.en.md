### Detailed Game Introduction

Daily Word Search hides words horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Themes change daily; you can play timed for a challenge or untimed to unwind.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Scan for distinctive letter patterns and rare letters (Q, Z, X).
2.  Highlight prefixes/suffixes from the word list.
3.  Sweep rows/columns systematically to avoid misses.
4.  Use hints only after a full grid sweep.
5.  In timed mode, take short breaks between clusters to avoid tunnel vision.

### Controls Guide

- Drag across letters to select words; release to confirm.
- Hints highlight a starting letter or full word depending on the build.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

  A: Yes, unless a mode restricts directions.

- Q: Can words overlap?
  
  A: Often yes; look for shared letters.

- Q: Timed vs relaxed — which to pick?
  
  A: Timed for speed practice; relaxed for unwinding.
