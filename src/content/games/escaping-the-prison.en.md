<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Henry Stickmin is locked up—use branching choices and slapstick tools to escape. Most options fail hilariously; a few lead to successful endings.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Pick an item/route when prompted; quick‑time moments require timely clicks.
- Unlock three main endings (e.g., Sneaky, Badass, Legal) by finding the correct sequences.
- Revisit scenes to collect all fails and bios if offered.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Mouse`: `click` choices and quick‑time prompts; `Space` for some interrupts (host dependent).


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- If stuck, explore the other major route branches; many scenes have alternative solutions.
- Bios (when present) trigger by clicking characters during scenes.
- Use scene select (if available) to mop up missing fails.
