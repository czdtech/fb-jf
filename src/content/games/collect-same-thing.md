### Detailed Game Introduction

Collect Same Thing challenges you to match identical tiles or items under space/time limits. Removing pairs reveals deeper layers; success requires opening lanes, prioritizing scarce tiles, and avoiding isolated singles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Open lanes first to expose hidden tiles.
2.  Match scarce items early before they clog the board.
3.  Work bottom‑up to create cascades (when layers exist).
4.  Avoid cornering singletons that have few partners.
5.  Save shuffles/hints for emergencies.

### Controls Guide

- Click/tap to select pairs per mode rules.
- Use hint/shuffle (if available) sparingly.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I get stuck with no pairs — what now?
  
  A: Shuffle if allowed or restart with a different opening that preserves lanes.

- Q: Timed or move limits?
  
  A: Modes vary; play faster for timers and plan deeper for move limits.

- Q: Any scoring tips?
  
  A: Chain quick pairs to maintain combo bonuses where supported.
