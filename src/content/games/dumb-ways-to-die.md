### Overview
Fast‑reaction micro‑games: complete short safety‑themed challenges under a rising speed curve. Fail three times and the run ends.

### How to Play
- Each round presents a different micro‑game with a brief prompt.
- Succeed quickly to keep lives and push the speed higher; mistakes cost hearts.
- Later rounds shuffle faster and add trick prompts.

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch swipes, taps, and holds; some hosts use arrow keys/space for specific games.

### Tips
- Read the prompt first—many losses come from instinctive wrong inputs.
- Expect repetition; memorize tricky games to react faster.
- Don’t over‑drag/over‑swipe; precision beats speed.

### FAQ
- Q: How many lives do I have?  
  A: Usually three strikes per run.
- Q: Can I practice a single game?  
  A: Some hosts offer practice lists; otherwise learn during runs.
- Q: Is there progression?  
  A: High‑score chase; some versions unlock characters or cosmetics.
