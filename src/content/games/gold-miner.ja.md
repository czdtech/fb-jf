### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Gold Miner is a timing‑based arcade game where a swinging claw drops on command to latch onto underground objects. Large gold chunks are heavy but lucrative; rocks are cheap and slow you down; diamonds are light and valuable. Each level has a cash target under a time limit, and a shop offers dynamite, strength drinks, and lucky clovers for tougher stages.

### How to Play
- Trigger the claw when its arc aligns with your target.
- Prioritize large gold early; use dynamite to ditch unwanted rocks.
- Purchase upgrades between rounds to meet higher goals.

### Controls
- One key/click to drop claw; additional keys for items (host dependent).

### Tips
- Learn arc timing—release slightly before the object’s center.
- Save dynamite for big rocks that waste time.
- Diamonds and mystery bags are high ROI; adjust targets by layout.
