### Overview
Going Balls is a tilt‑and‑roll style runner on narrow tracks filled with beams, bumpers, hammers, and moving platforms. Precision matters: small steering inputs maintain balance, while reckless speed sends you off the edge. Stages introduce gimmicks like magnets, ramps, and zip tracks; coins unlock cosmetic balls and continues.

### How to Play
- Feather steering to stay centered on beams; brake before sharp turns.
- Time moving obstacles (hammers, pushers) and cross in their recovery windows.
- Collect coins and keys along safer lines—don’t overreach.

### Controls
- WASD/Arrows or drag to steer; Space/brake where available; R to retry (host dependent).

### Tips
- Look ahead; line up early for narrow entries.
- On steep ramps, build speed first, then steer minimally.
- If you start wobbling, slow down to re‑center.

### FAQ
- Q: How can I stop falling off narrow beams?  
  A: Reduce steering amplitude and approach straight on; micro‑correct only.
- Q: What do coins unlock in the game?  
  A: Cosmetics and, on some hosts, continues or bonus levels.
- Q: Are there checkpoints in longer stages?  
  A: Many levels include mid‑checkpoints; endless modes typically do not.
