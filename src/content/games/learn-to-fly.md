### Overview
Learn to Fly is a distance launcher about iterative improvement. Launch a penguin down a ramp, control pitch to maximize glide, and use boosters sparingly. Earnings buy better gliders, rockets, and payloads, unlocking new goals and challenge modes across days.

### How to Play
- Set launch angle; keep pitch near optimal to maintain speed.
- Trigger boosters only when speed drops or to clear obstacles.
- Spend on speed and glide upgrades first, then utility.

### Controls
- Arrow keys adjust pitch; space/keys for boosters (host dependent).

### Tips
- Shallow dives regain speed; gentle climbs extend distance.
- Save fuel for late‑flight when drag slows you down.
- Daily goals guide efficient upgrade order.

### FAQ
- Q: What upgrades give the best early returns?  
  A: Base speed and glide efficiency outperform fancy extras early.
- Q: How do I hit distance targets consistently?  
  A: Maintain optimal pitch and reserve boosts for late flight.
- Q: Is there a hard cap on days?  
  A: You can keep improving until targets are met; challenge modes extend play.
