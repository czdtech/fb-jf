### Detailed Game Introduction

Jigsaw Puzzles Hexa offers a refreshing and modern take on the timeless jigsaw puzzle. Instead of traditional, uniquely shaped interlocking pieces, this game uses clusters of hexagonal blocks. Your goal is to drag these hexa shapes from your inventory and place them correctly onto the main board to complete a beautiful, high-definition picture. With no time limits, it provides a relaxing yet mentally stimulating experience that challenges your spatial reasoning.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Analyze the Shapes:** Before you start placing pieces, take a look at the shapes you are given. Unlike a normal jigsaw, you are working with geometric block clusters. Mentally picture how they might fit together on the board.
2.  **[DE]** **Start with Unique Outlines:** Look for distinctive parts of the puzzle outline. If there is a long, straight edge or a unique corner, find the piece in your inventory that would fit that specific shape. This helps to anchor your puzzle.
3.  **[DE]** **Work by Section:** Don't try to place pieces all over the board at once. Focus on completing one area, like a corner or a specific object in the picture. Completing one section often makes it much easier to see where the remaining pieces go.
4.  **[DE]** **Trial and Error:** Since the pieces don't have unique picture snippets like a normal jigsaw, you will often need to use trial and error. If a piece doesn't fit, simply drag it back to your inventory and try a different one.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with a simple drag-and-drop mechanic.

*   **[DE]** **Select and Place:** Use your mouse or finger to click and drag a hexagonal piece cluster from your inventory area and drop it onto the main puzzle board.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: Can I rotate the pieces?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** No. In this style of puzzle, the pieces have a fixed orientation. The challenge comes from figuring out how they fit together as they are.

*   **[DE]** **Q: I'm stuck and a piece won't fit anywhere! What should I do?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** This usually means one of the pieces you have already placed is in the wrong spot. You may need to remove one or more pieces from the board and rethink your arrangement. If the game offers a hint system, now would be a good time to use it.

*   **[DE]** **Q: Is there a time limit?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** No, the game is designed to be a relaxing, stress-free experience. You can take as much time as you need to solve each puzzle.
