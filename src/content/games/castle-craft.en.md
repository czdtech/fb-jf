### Detailed Game Introduction

Castle Craft is a captivating merge-and-build puzzle game where players embark on a journey to transform a modest plot of land into a magnificent medieval kingdom. The core gameplay revolves around the classic "merge-3" mechanic: combining three or more identical items to create a single, more advanced item. By strategically merging resources like wheat, wood, and stone, players can fulfill quests, earn valuable currency, and lift the fog to unlock new territories, gradually revealing a sprawling and prosperous empire.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Master the Merge-5:** While merging three items is the basic rule, always try to merge five identical items at once. A "merge-5" rewards you with a bonus, often an extra higher-level item, which significantly speeds up your progress.
2.  **Organize Your Board:** Don't let your land get cluttered. Keep similar items grouped together to make it easier to spot and execute large merges. Use open space strategically to maneuver items.
3.  **Focus on Quests:** Pay close attention to the quest log. Fulfilling quests and villager orders is the primary way to earn keys and coins, which are essential for unlocking new land and advancing the story.
4.  **Resource Management:** At times, you will need to decide which resource to focus on. If a quest requires high-level stone, dedicate a portion of your board to merging stone from basic rocks up to the required level. Don't spread your efforts too thin.
5.  **Unlock Land Wisely:** When you have enough keys, you can unlock a new patch of fog-covered land. Prioritize unlocking areas that give you the most building space or seem to lead towards critical quest items.

### Controls Guide

The game is controlled entirely with a mouse or touch screen.

    *   **A:** Keys are primarily earned by completing specific quests and fulfilling trade orders from the marketplace or villagers. Focus on these tasks to gather the keys you need.

*   **Q: What's the difference between merging 3 and merging 5?**
