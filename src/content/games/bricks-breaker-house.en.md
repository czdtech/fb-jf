### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Aim for controlled caroms around 30–45° to keep predictable loops.

3.  Carve side alleys to trap the ball near the ceiling for extended damage.
4.  Don’t over‑pursue bonuses if they jeopardize a catch.
5.  On tight boards, prioritize clearing bricks that open new angles.
