### Présentation du jeu

*Incredibox Wolfgang* rend hommage à Mozart et aux grands compositeurs classiques. Les personnages deviennent des musiciens d’orchestre, et chaque icône déclenche des **cordes, bois, cuivres, percussions ou chœurs** inspirés de la musique symphonique.


The objective is to allow players to create their own sophisticated classical pieces while also engaging in the puzzle of finding the three secret animated bonuses. These bonuses are beautifully animated vignettes that perfectly capture the grace and drama of the classical era.

The game transforms the usual beatboxers into a troupe of 18th-century performers, complete with powdered wigs and formal attire. Players use the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop interface to compose with a palette of 20 sound icons. The sound library is a complete orchestral and choral experience, featuring sounds from **harpsichords, violins, cellos, orchestral percussion, and powerful operatic vocals**.
### Stratégies de jeu et conseils

1.  **Pose la section rythmique légère**  
    Même en classique, quelques timbales ou percussions discrètes peuvent structurer le tempo.

2.  **Construis l’orchestre par familles**  
    Ajoute d’abord les cordes (violons/altos/violoncelles), puis les bois, puis les cuivres pour les accents héroïques.

    - **Utilise les chœurs pour les moments forts**  

    - **Use Solo to Appreciate Each Part**: The instrumentation in this mod is very detailed. Use the "solo" function to isolate the violin or a solo singer to fully appreciate their individual performance and understand their role in the full ensemble.

    - **Systematic Search for Bonuses**: The bonus combinations can be tricky to find. Lock in a core arrangement that sounds good, then methodically cycle through the remaining icons one by one. This is the most efficient way to unlock the elegant animations.

    - **Master Counterpoint and Harmony**: Classical music is all about how different melodies and harmonies interact. Experiment with layering different "Melody" and "Voice" icons on top of each other. Some will create beautiful harmonies, while others might clash. The discovery is part of the fun.

- **Build Your Orchestra from the Ground Up**: A good way to compose is to mimic how an orchestra is built. Start with the "Beats" category to lay down a rhythmic and harmonic foundation with the cellos and timpani.

- **Voices**: The vocals are purely operatic. This includes powerful **choral arrangements**, solo soprano and tenor voices, and dramatic harmonies that give the piece its human, emotional core.

- **Melodies**: These are the main melodic lines that carry the tune. This category features the soaring sounds of **violins**, elegant flute passages, and other lead instrumental hooks.

- **Effects**: This category provides the harmonic and textural background. It includes sounds like flowing **harpsichord arpeggios**, sustained notes from string sections, and other ambient orchestral colors.
    Les voix chorales donnent un effet « final de symphonie ». Garde‑les pour les passages importants.
