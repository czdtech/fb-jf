### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Elite Chess provides a streamlined chess experience against scalable AI or a local opponent. Improvement hinges on three pillars: (1) Opening principles — rapid development, king safety, and active piece placement; (2) Middlegame tactics — forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks, deflections; (3) Endgames — king activity, opposition, basic checkmates, and practical rook endings. Puzzles and adjustable levels help build calculation depth and pattern recall.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Openings: Occupy the center (pawns e4/d4/c4), develop knights before bishops, castle early, connect rooks.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Tactics scan: On every move, run “CCT” — Checks, Captures, Threats; look for forcing moves.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Pawn structure: Avoid unnecessary weaknesses (isolated/doubled/backward pawns); fix targets, seize open files.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Endgames: Activate your king, study K+Q vs K, K+R vs K, basic king‑pawn opposition, and Lucena/Philidor rook techniques.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Time management: When low on time, choose simple, healthy moves over deep complications.
