<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Train a racing duck across mini‑games (running, swimming, flying, climbing), then enter regional tournaments. Energy controls stamina; hats and evolutions change looks.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Improve each stat via its training mini‑game; avoid obstacles to gain XP quickly.
- Feed seeds to raise energy; low energy reduces race endurance.
- Win qualifying heats to unlock new areas and tournaments.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Arrows/`Mouse` depending on mini‑game; `Space` to jump in runners (host dependent).


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Rotate training so no single stat bottlenecks a race.
- Keep energy topped off before tournaments.
- Re‑run earlier tracks to grind safe XP if stuck.
