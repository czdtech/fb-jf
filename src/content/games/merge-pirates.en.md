### Detailed Game Introduction

Merge Pirates is a highly addictive and relaxing puzzle game where you take on the role of a pirate captain building your fleet. The gameplay revolves around merging identical pirate-themed items—like cannons, ship wheels, and treasure maps—to create new, higher-level items. Your goal is to fulfill orders for your crew, earn gold coins, and discover all the legendary pirate gear to become the most notorious captain on the seven seas.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Merge Chain:** The core of the game is merging. Drag one item and drop it onto an identical item to create a new, upgraded item. For example, two small cannons might merge into a larger, more powerful cannon.
2.  **Fulfill Orders:** At the top of the screen, you will see orders from your pirate crew. You must create the specific items they are asking for. Fulfilling an order is the primary way to earn gold coins.
3.  **Manage Your Board:** You only have a limited number of spaces on your board. If it fills up, you won't be able to receive new items. Always try to make merges to keep space free for new deliveries.
4.  **Use Your Gold:** Spend the coins you earn to buy more items from the shop. This is much faster than waiting for the free crate and is essential for creating high-level items to fill difficult orders.
