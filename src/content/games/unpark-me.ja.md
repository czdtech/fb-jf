### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Unpark Me is a classic sliding block puzzle game, also known as a "parking jam" puzzle. You are presented with a crowded parking lot grid filled with cars and trucks. Your goal is to strategically slide the other vehicles out of the way to clear a path for the target car (usually the red one) to drive out of the exit. The game is a true test of logic and sequential thinking, challenging you to solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible.
