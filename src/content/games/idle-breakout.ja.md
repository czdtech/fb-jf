### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Idle Breakout merges incremental progression with classic brick‑breaking. Early on you click to deal damage; soon you purchase balls with differing speed, damage, and special effects, plus automated launchers. Bricks scale health, bosses appear periodically, and prestige resets grant permanent multipliers that accelerate future runs.

### How to Play
- Invest early in cheap balls for constant DPS; add specials (sniper, scatter) later.
- Target upgrade breakpoints that double DPS rather than small steps.
- Prestige when progress stalls; compounding multipliers matter most.

### Controls
- Mouse: click to damage; UI to buy balls, upgrades, and prestige nodes.

### Tips
- Keep at least one high‑damage ball to burst bosses.
- Idle efficiency rises with automation; check in to re‑allocate spending.
- Use offline time multipliers if your host supports them.

### FAQ
- Q: When should I trigger a prestige reset?  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: When your brick clears slow to a crawl; earlier resets often yield faster long‑term growth.
- Q: Which ball types are best early in the game?  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Cheap, fast balls for coverage; add a sniper/strong ball for bosses.
- Q: Does the game progress offline?  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Some hosts simulate offline earnings; behavior varies.
