### Detailed Game Introduction

Mergest Kingdom combines merge‑3 chains with kingdom building. Merge plants, stones, and artifacts to craft higher tiers, clear fog, and unlock new regions. Quests and events provide targets; energy and space limit reckless merging, rewarding planned ladders.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Merge‑3 vs 5: Save sets of 5 for extra yield when feasible.

3.  **[FR]** Quest alignment: Prioritize merges that satisfy current quests to accelerate unlocks.
4.  **[FR]** Energy pacing: Spend in bursts on planned chains, then idle to regenerate.
5.  **[FR]** Event prep: Stock partial sets before events for rapid progression.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to merge items; tap buildings to collect; navigate regions via map.
