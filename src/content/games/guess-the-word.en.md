### Detailed Game Introduction

Guess The Word blends letter‑link input with crossword slots. You drag through letter wheels to form valid words that populate a grid. Difficulty grows with trick anagrams, uncommon digrams, and sparse vowels, rewarding pattern recognition and strategic guesswork.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with obvious short words to anchor crossings.
2.  Work from prefixes/suffixes (re‑, un‑, ‑ing, ‑ed) to inflate options.
3.  Use letter frequency — E/A/R/S/T appear more; hunt words around them.
4.  Bank bonus words for hints in late boards.
5.  When stuck, reshuffle mental order (middle‑out) to discover new strings.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to connect letters; release to submit; use hints sparingly.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: A slot seems impossible — tips?
  
  A: Recheck crossings and try anagrams with the fixed letters (e.g., _ate → eat/tea/eta).

- Q: Are plurals/proper nouns allowed?
  
  A: Depends on the dictionary; generally no proper nouns.

- Q: Can I replay for more coins?
  
  A: Usually yes — revisit earlier grids for bonuses.
