### **Incredibox Rave Game Introduction**

*Incredibox Rave* is a visually striking fan-made mod for the music creation game Incredibox. This version transports players directly into the energetic atmosphere of a **rave or nightclub**, complete with large speakers, a disco ball, and dynamic spotlights. The characters are stylized as silhouetted or neon-outlined figures, resembling DJs and club-goers.

The game uses the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop gameplay. Players are given a palette of 20 sound icons, which are represented by abstract geometric shapes and stylized lips. By assigning these icons to the seven performers, players can compose their own high-energy tracks inspired by various genres of **electronic dance music (EDM), such as techno, house, and disco**.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

Strategy in *Incredibox Rave* is about layering the different electronic elements to build a track that could be played in a real club.

1.  **Understand the Electronic Sound Palette**: The abstract icons can be grouped into the four standard categories based on their function.
    *   **Beats (Squares)**: The icons shaped like squares are your rhythmic foundation. Expect to find driving **drum machine patterns**, electronic kicks, snares, and hi-hats.
    *   **Effects (Circles)**: The circular icons provide the atmospheric and bass elements. This includes deep **synth basslines**, ambient pads, and other textures that fill out the soundscape.
    *   **Melodies (Triangles)**: The triangular icons are your main hooks and riffs. These represent **lead synth melodies**, catchy arpeggios, and other melodic patterns that define the track's tune.
    *   **Voices (Lips)**: The icons shaped like lips are the vocal elements. Look for **processed vocal samples**, ad-libs, and melodic vocal chops that are common in electronic music.

2.  **Four-on-the-Floor Foundation**: A great way to start a club track is to find a solid "four-on-the-floor" kick drum pattern from the "Beats" (squares) category. This provides the classic, danceable pulse.

3.  **Build the Groove**: Once the beat is established, add a bassline from the "Effects" (circles) category. A good synergy between the kick drum and the bass is key to making the track feel powerful and groovy.

4.  **Layer for Energy**: Build energy by adding melodic elements. Start with a simple synth pad ("Effects") to create space, then add a catchy lead melody ("Melodies"). Finally, drop in a vocal chop ("Voices") to complete the mix.

5.  **Systematic Bonus Hunting**: To find the secret bonuses, be methodical. Establish a solid beat and bassline, then systematically swap out the melody and voice icons one by one until you trigger one of the rave-themed animations.
