### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Neon Rider is a side‑view bike‑physics platformer focused on smooth landings and momentum. Control pitch mid‑air, manage throttle over bumps, and chain jumps without over‑rotating to keep speed.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Land flat: Aim to touch down with wheels level to retain speed.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Tap throttle: Feather power on bumpy terrain to avoid nose dives.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Early corrections: Start pitch corrections in the air, not on landing.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Small flips only: Flip when safe and with enough arc; unnecessary flips bleed speed.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Learn lines: Memorize jump lengths and landing spots for perfect flow.

### Controls Guide

- Accelerate/Brake: Up/Down or W/S.
- Lean: Left/Right or A/D.
- Restart: Quick restart to drill hard segments.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I keep nosing in—why? Too much throttle off lips; ease off before takeoff.
- How to keep momentum? Land level and avoid over‑rotations; pump small dips.
