### Detailed Game Introduction

Survivor Legends follows the auto‑attack survivor formula: move to kite, level to draft weapons/passives, and survive crescendos. Builds hinge on damage schedules (DPS vs burst), crowd control, and pickup radius for XP economy.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Wide kites: Large loops give correction time; avoid tight corners.
2.  **[FR]** Priority: Kill fast/ranged first; slow melee later.
3.  **[FR]** Draft synergies: Pair pierce with knockback, slow with crit, or aura with sustain.
4.  **[FR]** Economy: Invest in pickup radius/XP early to accelerate drafts.
5.  **[FR]** Ult windows: Save actives for wave spikes and elite packs.

### Controls Guide

- Move: WASD/Arrows; actives on number keys; pause via UI.
