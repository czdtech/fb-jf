### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Domino Battle is a digital adaptation of the classic tile-based game, Dominoes. This version pits you against a computer opponent in a strategic battle of wits. The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your domino tiles by matching them end-to-end with the layout on the board. It requires careful planning, as you must not only play your own tiles but also anticipate and potentially block your opponent's moves.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **The Basics:** Each player starts with a hand of dominoes. The player with the highest double-tile typically goes first. On your turn, you must place a tile from your hand so that one of its ends matches the number of pips on an open end of the domino chain.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Playing Doubles:** Double-tiles (e.g., a 6-6) are often played perpendicularly to the main line, creating a "spinner" with multiple open ends to play off of, which can open up the game significantly.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Drawing from the Boneyard:** If you do not have a playable tile in your hand, you must draw from the stock pile (the "boneyard") until you pick one that you can play. If the boneyard is empty and you still cannot play, you must pass your turn.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Winning a Round:** The round ends when one player plays their last domino. That player then scores points equal to the total number of pips on all the dominoes remaining in the opponent's hand.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Blocking the Game:** If neither player can make a move and the boneyard is empty, the game is "blocked." In this case, the player with the lowest total pip count in their hand wins the round and scores points based on the opponent's hand.
