### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bridge is a classic and highly strategic trick-taking card game played by four players in two competing partnerships. Players sit opposite their partners. The game consists of two main phases: the Bidding (or Auction) and the Play. During bidding, the partnerships compete to determine the "contract," which specifies the trump suit and the number of tricks that partnership must win. During the play, the side that won the bid (the declarer) tries to fulfill their contract, while the defenders try to stop them. It is widely considered one of the world's greatest mind sports.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **The Bidding:** This is the first phase. Players take turns making bids. A bid consists of a number (1-7) and a suit (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades) or "No-Trump" (NT). The number corresponds to the number of tricks over 6 that the partnership commits to winning (e.g., a bid of 3 Hearts means they must win at least 9 tricks with Hearts as the trump suit). The highest bid becomes the final contract.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **The Play:** The player from the winning partnership who first named the suit of the contract becomes the "declarer." Their partner becomes the "dummy," and places their hand face-up on the table for everyone to see. The declarer plays both their own hand and the dummy's hand.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Trick-Taking:** The player to the declarer's left leads the first card. Other players must follow suit if they can. The player who plays the highest card of the suit led wins the trick, unless a trump card is played. If a trump card is played, the highest trump card wins. The winner of a trick leads the next one.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Scoring:** If the declarer's side makes their contract (wins the required number of tricks or more), they score points. If they fail, the defending side scores points.
