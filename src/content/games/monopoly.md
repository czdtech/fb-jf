### Game Introduction

"Monopoly" is a classic real estate board game where players roll dice to move around the game board, buying, renting, and selling properties. The goal is to bankrupt other players and ultimately become the wealthiest tycoon. The game combines elements of strategy, negotiation, and luck, and is loved by players worldwide.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Buy Properties**: When you land on an unowned property, you can choose to buy it, making it your asset.
2.  **Build Houses and Hotels**: After acquiring all properties of the same color group, you can build houses and hotels on them to increase rental income.
3.  **Collect Rent**: When other players land on your property, they must pay you rent. Properties with houses and hotels yield higher rents.
4.  **Trade and Negotiate**: Engage in property or card trades with other players, negotiating to acquire a more advantageous asset portfolio.
5.  **Manage Finances**: Plan your finances wisely to ensure you have enough cash flow to cover rents, taxes, and unforeseen events.

### How to Play

*   **Roll Dice**: Click the dice during your turn to roll them, determining how many spaces your token moves.
*   **Buy/Build**: When your token lands on a purchasable property, a buying option will appear. Once you own a complete color group, you can click on properties to build.
*   **Trade**: Initiate trades with other players, selecting properties or cards you wish to exchange.
*   **Pay**: When landing on a space that requires rent or tax payment, you will be prompted to pay automatically.
