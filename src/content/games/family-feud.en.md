<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Two teams try to guess top answers from survey questions. Rounds award points based on answer popularity; Fast Money closes with rapid‑fire questions.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Face‑off: first correct answer gains control; the team reveals remaining answers or passes play.
- Three strikes pass control; the other team can steal with one correct answer.
- Final “Fast Money” totals points from two players’ rapid answers.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Keyboard entry for answers; `Enter` to submit; arrow/onscreen UI to navigate (host dependent).


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Think broad categories first (e.g., “fruit,” “car,” “money”).
- Aim for synonyms if an obvious word is taken.
- Short, common words often rank higher than niche terms.
