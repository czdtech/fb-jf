### Detailed Game Introduction

Guess Their Answer plays like a family‑feud style survey game. Given a prompt (“Things you bring to the beach”), you must list common answers. Points scale by popularity; obscure answers score little. The meta is not niche knowledge but modeling average respondents.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with categories: People, objects, actions; then expand synonyms (e.g., sunglasses/shades).
2.  Cover spectrum: List one answer per sub‑theme rather than synonyms first to maximize early coverage.
3.  Think demographics: Family answers skew practical and familiar.
4.  Don’t overfit: If an answer flops, pivot quickly to a different sub‑theme.
5.  Head‑to‑head: Block likely opponent picks early.

### Controls Guide

- Type answers and submit; the game checks popularity lists.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My clever answers don’t score — why?
  
  A: Scoring favors common responses. Switch to broadly familiar items/actions.

- Q: Are misspellings accepted?
  
  A: Some variants autocorrect; others require correct spelling or close matches.

- Q: Any hint system?
  
  A: Some modes offer letter hints or reveal the category breadth.
