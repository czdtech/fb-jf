### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Check the Order:** As soon as a customer arrives, look at the bubble above their head to see what kind of pizza they want. Pay close attention to the toppings.
2.  **Prepare the Pizza:** Start by grabbing a dough ball. Add the tomato sauce, and then apply the specific toppings the customer requested.
3.  **Bake to Perfection:** Place the pizza in the oven. Keep an eye on the timer! An undercooked or burnt pizza will make your customers unhappy.
4.  **Serve Quickly:** Once the pizza is perfectly baked, take it out and serve it to the waiting customer. The faster you serve, the better your tip and the happier the customer.
5.  **Manage Multiple Orders:** As you progress, you will have to juggle multiple orders at once. Create a workflow that allows you to prepare several pizzas simultaneously to keep up with the demand.
