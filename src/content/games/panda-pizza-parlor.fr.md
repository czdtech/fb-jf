### Detailed Game Introduction

Welcome to Panda Pizza Parlor, a charming and fast-paced cooking game where you run your very own pizza shop! As the head panda chef, your job is to take orders, prepare delicious pizzas with the correct toppings, bake them to perfection, and serve them to a variety of hungry animal customers. Manage your time effectively to keep your customers happy, earn money, and grow your pizza business from a humble parlor into a world-famous pizzeria.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **Check the Order:** As soon as a customer arrives, look at the bubble above their head to see what kind of pizza they want. Pay close attention to the toppings.
2.  **[FR]** **Prepare the Pizza:** Start by grabbing a dough ball. Add the tomato sauce, and then apply the specific toppings the customer requested.
3.  **[FR]** **Bake to Perfection:** Place the pizza in the oven. Keep an eye on the timer! An undercooked or burnt pizza will make your customers unhappy.
4.  **[FR]** **Serve Quickly:** Once the pizza is perfectly baked, take it out and serve it to the waiting customer. The faster you serve, the better your tip and the happier the customer.
5.  **[FR]** **Manage Multiple Orders:** As you progress, you will have to juggle multiple orders at once. Create a workflow that allows you to prepare several pizzas simultaneously to keep up with the demand.
