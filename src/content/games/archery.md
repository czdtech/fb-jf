### Detailed Game Introduction

Archery World Tour is a realistic and challenging archery simulation game. You travel to various scenic locations to compete in archery tournaments. The goal is to score as many points as possible by shooting arrows at a target. Success requires more than just a steady hand; you must also account for environmental factors like wind speed, wind direction, and the distance to the target, making it a true test of skill.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Compensate for Wind:** Before each shot, look at the wind indicator. It will show you the direction and strength of the wind. You must aim slightly *against* the wind to counteract its effect on your arrow.
2.  **Account for Gravity:** For targets at a long distance, your arrow will drop slightly due to gravity. You will need to aim a little bit higher than the bullseye to ensure your arrow hits the center.
3.  **Timing Your Release:** In some versions, your aim may sway slightly. Wait for the moment your crosshair is perfectly still and aligned with your intended target before releasing the arrow.
4.  **Aim for the Bullseye:** The center of the target (the yellow circle) is worth the most points (usually 10). Consistent bullseyes are the key to a high score.

### Controls Guide

*   **Aim:** Move your mouse to aim the bow. The cursor will show where the arrow is pointed.
*   **Draw and Shoot:** Click and hold the left mouse button to draw the bowstring. A power meter or the aiming reticle may change as you hold. Release the mouse button to fire the arrow.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I aim with the wind?**
    *   **A:** You must aim in the opposite direction of the wind. If the wind is blowing strongly to the right, you need to aim to the left of the target center. The stronger the wind, the further you need to compensate.

*   **Q: Why did my arrow hit low?**
    *   **A:** This is due to gravity, especially on long-distance shots. You need to aim slightly above where you want the arrow to hit to account for the drop.

*   **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
    *   **A:** To score the highest number of points by shooting a set number of arrows at the target. The closer you are to the bullseye, the more points you get.
