### Overview
Gunspin turns recoil into movement: each shot spins and propels your weapon/body forward. Stages scatter ammo, coins, and hazards. Managing angle and shot timing yields long glides and chain pickups; upgrades add firepower and control.

### How to Play
- Fire at shallow angles to maintain forward velocity.
- Save bursts for upward corrections or hazard avoidance.
- Spend coins on guns that match your style (spread vs. precise).

### Controls
- Mouse/Space to shoot; timing and aim set trajectory.

### Tips
- Small taps > full bursts for efficiency.
- Aim slightly behind your path to push forward without stalling.
- Use bounce surfaces to refresh trajectory.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I keep momentum without stalling?  
  A: Shoot with shallow backward angles and short taps.
- Q: What upgrades help most early?  
  A: Ammo capacity and controllable recoil.
- Q: Is there an end to the levels?  
  A: It’s distance‑based; aim for personal bests.
