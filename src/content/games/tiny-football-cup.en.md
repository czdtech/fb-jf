### Detailed Game Introduction

Tiny Football Cup condenses football into quick matches with snappy dribbling and simple set pieces. Offense favors through‑balls and across‑goal finishes; defense rewards shape and timely presses.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Two‑touch play: Pass‑shoot beats dribbling into traffic.
2.  Far‑post shots: Across‑goal strikes are forgiving.
3.  Press triggers: Pounce after bad touches; don’t over‑commit.
4.  Corners: Mix short corners with box shots.
5.  GK: Move late; attackers telegraph last‑second angles.
