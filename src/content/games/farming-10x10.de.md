### Detailed Game Introduction

Farming 10x10 is a calm shape‑placement puzzle on a 10×10 grid. You receive sets of three pieces; place them to complete rows/columns and score clears. The run ends when no legal placements remain, so the art is in preserving flexibility while constructing multi‑line clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Keep the center breathable; tidy edges gradually to avoid single‑cell traps.
2.  **[DE]** Reserve a pocket sized for the most awkward triominoes.
3.  **[DE]** Place the hardest piece first when the board is crowded.
4.  **[DE]** Build two‑line setups so one placement scores double clears.
5.  **[DE]** Avoid creating 1×n “spines” that only fit sticks.

### Controls Guide

- Drag pieces to the board; release to place; some modes allow rotate.
- Undo/Reset if provided.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I keep running out of room — solutions?

A: Maintain a central open area, set aside an awkward‑piece pocket, and prioritize double clear setups.

- Q: Rotate is missing?

A: Many 10×10 variants do not rotate; compensate with better pocketing.
