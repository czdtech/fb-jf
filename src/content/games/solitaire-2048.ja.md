### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Solitaire 2048 converts merge logic into a card stream. You place cards (2, 4, 8…) into columns; adjacent equals merge to the next value. The trick is sequencing so merges cascade and free space rather than clog lanes.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
