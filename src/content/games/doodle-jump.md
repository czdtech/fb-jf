### Overview
Endless vertical platformer: bounce upward, land on safe platforms, avoid monsters and broken boards, and use power‑ups (springs, propeller caps, jetpacks) to climb higher.

### How to Play
- Keep the doodler centered and chain safe landings; falling off‑screen ends the run.
- Eliminate or avoid enemies; some versions allow tapping/shooting upward.
- Use moving or breakable platforms carefully; plan two steps ahead.

### Controls
- Left/Right (or tilt on mobile): move; automatic jumping on contact; action/shoot where available.

### Tips
- Favor stable platforms when the screen scrolls quickly.
- Save high‑impact power‑ups for sparse sections.
- Wraparound edges to escape traps when supported.

### FAQ
- Q: Are levels finite?  
  A: No—score rises until you miss a platform or hit a hazard.
- Q: Do platforms differ?  
  A: Yes—static, moving, disappearing/breakable, and trampolines/springs.
- Q: Are there bosses?  
  A: Usually no; it’s a score chase.
