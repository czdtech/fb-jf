### Detailed Game Introduction

Reversi Mania is a faithful, fast‑to‑learn implementation of Reversi (also known as Othello). Players take turns placing discs on an 8×8 board to outflank the opponent’s discs in straight lines (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). Any outflanked discs flip to your color. If a player has no legal move that flips at least one disc, they must pass; the game ends when neither side can move (usually when the board is full). The side with more discs wins.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Corners first: Corner discs can never be flipped; securing corners often decides the game.
2.  Avoid “X‑squares” early: The diagonally adjacent squares to corners (X‑squares) often give your opponent an easy corner capture.
3.  Edge stability: Edges are powerful once stabilized; build safely from corners before expanding along the edge.
4.  Mobility over material (early): Keep your options open and deny moves to your opponent; too many early flips can backfire.
5.  Parity (endgame): Aim to move last in the final regions; controlling whether a region has odd/even empties can secure the final swing.

### Controls Guide

- Place a disc: `Click` or `tap` a legal square (most implementations highlight valid moves). A legal move must flip at least one opposing disc.
- Passing: If no legal move exists, the game auto‑passes or prompts you to pass.
- Modes: Single‑player (vs. AI) or local 2‑player are commonly available.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:reversi-mania:what-makes-a-move-legal-086cedf1 -->
  What makes a move legal? It must outflank one or more opponent discs in a straight line; all outflanked discs flip.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:reversi-mania:what-if-neither-side-can-cabe279e -->
  What if neither side can move? The game ends and the side with more discs on the board wins.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:reversi-mania:is-going-first-stronger-cfd85fbd -->
  Is going first stronger? Initiative helps, but strong play revolves around corners, mobility, and endgame parity.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:reversi-mania:any-quick-tip-for-beginners-955da046 -->
  Any quick tip for beginners? Don’t over‑flip early; fight for mobility and avoid X‑squares until you can secure corners.
