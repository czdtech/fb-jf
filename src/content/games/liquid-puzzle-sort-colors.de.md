### Detailed Game Introduction

Liquid puzzle sort colors adapts the viral bottle‑sorting formula: pour liquids between bottles so each ends up uniform. You can pour only onto the same color or an empty bottle. Success demands planning buffers and ordering pours to avoid softlocks where no move remains.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Keep two buffers empty if possible; they’re your escape valves.
2.  **[DE]** Build from completed bottles outward; lock finished colors early.
3.  **[DE]** Top‑down pours: Move top colors to consolidate stacks before addressing deep layers.
4.  **[DE]** Avoid burying singletons; surface odd colors early to prevent traps.
5.  **[DE]** Deadlock check: If all moves reverse progress, undo and change the pour order.

### Controls Guide

- Tap a source bottle, then a destination; undo/reset if available; hints may suggest a pour.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I reach unwinnable states — how to prevent?

A: Preserve buffers, avoid burying singles, and commit a bottle as soon as it’s uniform.

- Q: Any universal opener?

A: Consolidate the most frequent color first; it frees buffers fastest.

- Q: Are hints reliable?

A: Decent for early steps; deep puzzles still need planning.
