### Overview
Google’s Klondike solitaire offers draw‑1 or draw‑3 modes. Build four foundations per suit from Ace to King, using tableau columns that build down in alternating colors. Empty tableau spaces accept only Kings (or King‑led stacks).

### How to Play
- Expose facedown cards by staging moves across columns.
- Move Aces and low cards to foundations as soon as practical.
- Cycle the stock; in draw‑3, plan three‑card order and waste pile parity.

### Controls
- Mouse/touch drag‑and‑drop; double‑click auto‑moves when legal.

### Tips
- Prefer moves that reveal a face‑down card.
- Keep at least one empty column ready for maneuvering.
- In draw‑3, track the cycle to avoid softlocks.

### FAQ
- Q: What starts a new foundation?  
  A: Aces begin each suit’s foundation, then build up in‑suit to King.
- Q: Can any card be moved to an empty space?  
  A: Only Kings (or King‑headed stacks) can occupy empty tableau columns.
- Q: How do draw‑1 and draw‑3 differ?  
  A: Draw‑1 reveals each card in order; draw‑3 cycles the stock in groups of three and is harder.
