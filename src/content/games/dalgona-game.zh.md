### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Dalgona Game is a careful tracing challenge inspired by honeycomb candy. Carve out the stamped shape by following edges; too much pressure or off‑path cuts crack the candy and fail the round.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Slow and steady near corners; speed only on straight segments.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Follow grooves; don’t force turns across the grain.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Watch micro‑cracks; if they spread, lift and re‑approach.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Save tight angles for last after stabilizing long edges.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Manage the timer by alternating quick/slow sections.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to trace the outline; pressure/angle sensitivity varies by build.
- Restart quickly on breaks.
