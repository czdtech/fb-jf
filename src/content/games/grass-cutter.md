### Overview
Grass Cutter is a route‑planning puzzle where a mower moves cell‑by‑cell or in straight lines until blocked (host dependent). The goal is to cut all grassy tiles without getting stuck, while rocks, water, and one‑way tiles complicate routes. Later stages add switches and teleporters.

### How to Play
- Survey the grid; identify choke points you must pass once.
- Use blockers to stop long slides at the right cells (if sliding rules apply).
- Leave return paths open so you can cover remaining tiles.

### Controls
- Arrow keys or swipe to move; undo/restart buttons are common.

### Tips
- Work backward from hard‑to‑reach corners.
- If you slide, set up “stoppers” to end on target tiles.
- Restart early when a route seals off uncut tiles.

### FAQ
- Q: What ends a level unsuccessfully?  
  A: Leaving uncut tiles with no legal path or running out of moves (in move‑limited variants).
- Q: Are there hints in the game?  
  A: Many hosts provide limited hints or an undo stack.
- Q: Do all versions use sliding movement?  
  A: Some do, others are step‑based—check the rules on your host.
