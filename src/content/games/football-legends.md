### Overview
Fast 1v1/2v2 football with exaggerated physics and special kicks. Modes include quick match and tournament brackets.

### How to Play
- Position for headers and volleys; time power shots when the meter is full.
- Use walls/bounces to set up angles; protect your goal after a kickoff.
- In 2‑player, coordinate roles: one presses, one covers.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; shot/pass keys and special vary by host.

### Tips
- Jump‑timed headers are the safest way to score.
- Save specials for open looks rather than congested scrums.
- On defense, backpedal and block angles instead of lunging.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I activate a special shot?  
  A: Fill the meter via play, then press the special key shown on your host.
- Q: Does 2‑player work on one keyboard?  
  A: Yes, most versions map two separate key sets.
- Q: Are there teams with different stats?  
  A: Many hosts offer team skins; physics are generally consistent.
