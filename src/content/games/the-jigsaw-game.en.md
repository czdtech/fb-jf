### Detailed Game Introduction

The Jigsaw Game is a classic digital jigsaw experience with selectable images and piece counts. Work the edges first, cluster by colors/patterns, and assemble sections before joining them into the final picture.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Edge pass: Complete the frame early to anchor interior groups.
2.  Sort pieces: Separate by color, texture, and distinctive shapes.
3.  Build islands: Finish small themed areas (sky, grass, faces) and merge later.
4.  Rotate if needed: Some modes require rotation—keep orientation consistent.
5.  Zoom/pan: Use tools to increase accuracy on dense areas.

### Controls Guide

- `Drag` to move pieces; rotate if the mode supports it.
- Zoom and pan via UI controls or gestures.
- Snap: Pieces usually auto‑snap when correctly placed.
