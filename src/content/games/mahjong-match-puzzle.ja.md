### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mahjong Match Puzzle uses layered stacks where only open tiles (no cover, at least one free side) can be matched. Some boards introduce connect‑style paths or special tiles. Efficiency comes from freeing caps, preserving options, and avoiding early removal that seals deeper pairs.
