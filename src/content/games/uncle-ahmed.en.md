### Detailed Game Introduction

Uncle Ahmed is a classic 2D side-scrolling platformer that will evoke nostalgia for games like Super Mario Bros. Players take on the role of the heroic Uncle Ahmed on a quest to rescue his nephew, who has been kidnapped by an evil sorcerer. You will journey through dozens of levels filled with various enemies, tricky obstacles, and helpful power-ups. The goal is to reach the end of each stage, defeat the sorcerer, and save the day.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Master the Jump:** Your most important skill is jumping. Use it to stomp on enemies to defeat them, break blocks to find coins and power-ups, and navigate over dangerous pits and spikes.
2.  **Collect Everything:** Grab all the coins you see. These can often be used to purchase extra lives, allowing you to continue if you make a mistake. Also, be sure to grab any power-ups you find.
3.  **Know Your Power-ups:** Power-ups are essential for survival. A watermelon might allow you to throw projectiles, while a hot pepper could grant you a temporary speed boost. Use them wisely to clear out difficult sections.
4.  **Explore for Secrets:** Don't just run straight to the finish line. Some levels contain hidden areas or secret blocks that hold extra lives or valuable power-ups. Exploration is often rewarded.

### Controls Guide

*   **Move:** Use the **Left and Right Arrow Keys** or on-screen buttons to move Uncle Ahmed.
*   **Jump:** Press the **Up Arrow Key** or the dedicated jump button.
*   **Shoot:** If you have a projectile power-up (like the watermelon), a separate button will typically appear to allow you to shoot.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I defeat the enemies?**
    *   **A:** The most common way is to jump directly on top of their heads. If you have an offensive power-up, you can also use that to attack them from a distance.

*   **Q: What happens if I lose all my lives?**
    *   **A:** If you run out of lives, the game is over, and you will have to start the level from the beginning (or from the last checkpoint).

*   **Q: How do I beat the final boss?**
    *   **A:** Boss battles usually require you to learn their attack patterns. Dodge their attacks and look for a moment of vulnerability when you can jump on their head or hit them with a projectile.
