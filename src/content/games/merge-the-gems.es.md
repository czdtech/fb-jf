### Detailed Game Introduction

Merge the Gems is a simple, relaxing, and highly addictive puzzle game centered around merging identical gems to create new, more valuable ones. You start with basic, uncut stones and combine them to progressively form sparkling, elaborate jewels. The goal is to manage your game board, continuously merge to discover new gem types, and fulfill objectives to earn points and coins.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **The Merge Chain:** The core of the game is to drag one gem and drop it onto an identical gem. The two will then merge into a single, new gem of a higher level. The key is to keep merging to create more space and discover more valuable jewels.
2.  **[ES]** **Manage Your Board:** Your board has a limited number of spaces. If it fills up completely, you won't be able to add new gems. Always prioritize making merges to keep your board from getting cluttered.
3.  **[ES]** **Use Coins to Accelerate:** While the game will periodically give you a free basic gem, the fastest way to progress is to use the coins you earn to buy more gems from the shop. This allows you to create high-level gems much more quickly.
4.  **[ES]** **Fulfill Goals:** Pay attention to any goals or orders that may appear. Completing these challenges is the best way to earn large amounts of coins and advance in the game.
