### Detailed Game Introduction

Granny Hero is a lighthearted runner where a spry granny dashes through streets, avoids slapstick hazards, and collects items to aid neighbors. Expect lane swaps, jump/slide timing, and occasional gadgets (scooters, umbrellas, pans) that grant brief invulnerability or crowd‑control.

2.  Jump/slide rhythm: Late jumps clear hurdles; slides beat low bars.
3.  Power‑up economy: Save shields/speed boosts for dense stretches.
4.  Mission focus: Prioritize rescue targets over side coins when routes conflict.
5.  Recovery: After a mistake, re‑establish cadence before chasing score.
