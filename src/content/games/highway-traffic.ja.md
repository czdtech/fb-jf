### **Game Introduction**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] "Highway Traffic" is a general name for a popular genre of arcade-style driving games. The core gameplay revolves around driving a car on a busy, seemingly endless highway. The primary objective is straightforward: **drive as long as possible to achieve the highest score and longest distance without crashing into other vehicles.**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] These games typically use a first-person or a third-person chase camera perspective, creating an immersive high-speed driving experience. Players must weave through dense traffic, using precise lane changes and overtakes to maintain high speed. The challenge intensifies as speed increases and time passes, with traffic becoming heavier and AI vehicle behavior potentially more erratic, requiring quick reflexes and good predictive skills.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Drive Smoothly, Don't Jerk the Wheel**: At high speeds, small and smooth steering inputs are far more effective than sudden, sharp turns. Jerking the wheel can easily lead to losing control or overcorrecting, which often results in a crash.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **"Near Misses" are Key to High Scores**: Almost all games in this genre have a bonus system where you get extra points or nitro for overtaking another car at a very close distance. Mastering this skill is crucial for achieving high scores, but it comes with high risk.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Look Far Ahead and Anticipate**: Don't just focus on the car directly in front of you. Your gaze should be as far down the road as possible, observing the movement of three or four cars ahead. This allows you to anticipate which lane will open up or which car might suddenly change lanes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Use Brakes, But Don't Abuse Them**: Brakes are a lifesaver for avoiding imminent collisions, but frequent or heavy braking will kill your speed and lower your scoring efficiency. Prioritize avoiding danger through smooth lane changes and only use heavy braking as a last resort.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Utilize the Oncoming Lane in Two-Way Mode**: In two-way traffic mode, the oncoming lane often has less traffic and is a prime opportunity for near misses and score boosting. However, it's extremely dangerous. You must constantly watch for approaching cars and be ready to merge back into your lane.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 6.  **Upgrade Your Ride**: Don't be stingy with your in-game currency. Prioritize upgrading your car's **Handling** and **Brakes** first. These two stats are vital for surviving in dense traffic. Speed is important, but it's useless if you can't control it.
