### Detailed Game Introduction

Scooter Xtreme 3D is an action-packed stunt and racing game that puts you on a scooter in a vibrant 3D world. Your goal is to navigate through challenging courses filled with ramps, rails, and obstacles. Perform incredible stunts like flips and grinds to rack up points, collect coins, and race to the finish line. Use your earnings to unlock new scooters and characters to become the ultimate scooter champion.
