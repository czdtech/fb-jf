### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Daily Word Climb is a clever and challenging word puzzle that provides a new brain-teaser every day. The goal is to unscramble a grid of letters to form correct words in each row. You do this by swapping letters one at a time. After each swap, the tiles change color to give you clues, helping you deduce the correct placement of each letter. With a limited number of moves, you must think strategically to solve the puzzle.
