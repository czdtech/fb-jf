### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Om Nom Bubbles is a classic bubble‑shooter starring the beloved Om Nom. Aim and shoot colored bubbles to make matches of three or more and clear sections of the board. Strategic banking off the walls, color management, and planning for upcoming bubbles are key to keeping the ceiling from dropping too low.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Target anchors: Remove clusters that hold large sections; collapsing big groups accelerates clears.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Bank for angles: Use the side walls to reach tucked‑away clusters and collect star objectives efficiently.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Manage colors: If a color is scarce, avoid burying it deep; prioritize colors that unlock the broadest collapses.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Look ahead: Many versions show the next bubble—pre‑plan two moves to avoid blocking your own lanes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Don’t chase tiny groups: When the ceiling is low, clear access lanes first, then finish leftovers.
