### Detailed Game Introduction

FullSpeed Racing delivers approachable circuit racing. Learn track layouts, brake in straight lines, apex smoothly, and accelerate early without wheelspin. Clean overtakes and consistency win more races than raw top speed.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Brake early: Enter slower, exit faster; avoid mid‑corner braking.
2.  **[DE]** Late apex: Turn slightly later to straighten exits and open throttle sooner.
3.  **[DE]** Defend fair: Hold a single defensive line; avoid weaving.
4.  **[DE]** Watch minimap: Anticipate traffic and blue‑flag faster cars.
5.  **[DE]** Consistency: String clean laps; mistakes cost more than cautious corners.

### Controls Guide

- Steer: A/D or Left/Right.
- Throttle/Brake: W/S or Up/Down.
- Nitro/Handbrake (if any): Mapped per mode; use sparingly.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I understeer off track—why? Too fast at turn‑in; brake earlier and trail less speed.
- How to pass cleanly? Set up exits and use slipstream on straights.
- Do upgrades matter? Some modes offer car unlocks; craft suits track style.
