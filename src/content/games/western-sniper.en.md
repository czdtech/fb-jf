Western Sniper delivers short missions with bandits, explosives, and moving targets. Success means calm reticles, priority picks (rifles/throwers first), and resource care (ammo/time/bonus objectives).

2.  Hold breath: Time shots at sway minima for accuracy.
3.  Environmental kills: Use barrels/ropes for multi‑downs.

5.  Optional goals: Attempt only when the field is safe.

### Controls Guide
