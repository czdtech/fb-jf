### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bob the Robber is a series of 2D stealth puzzle-platformer games. The player takes on the role of Bob, a skilled thief with a sense of justice (often portrayed as a modern-day Robin Hood), who infiltrates various secure locations like houses, banks, and museums. The objective of each level is to navigate the environment, collect a specific target loot item, and reach the exit without getting caught.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The core gameplay revolves around avoiding detection. Levels are filled with a variety of security measures, including patrolling guards, security cameras, laser grids, and locked doors. The player must use observation, timing, and stealth to overcome these obstacles. Hiding in the shadows is a key mechanic, making Bob invisible to most threats. Successfully completing a level often requires solving small puzzles, such as finding keycodes or lockpicking doors, all while remaining unseen.

The controls are generally consistent across the series and are very simple.（日本語訳が必要）
### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Patience is Your Best Tool:** Do not rush. The most common mistake is running into a guard's patrol route. Take time at the start of each screen to observe the patterns of guards and cameras.
    - **Knockout:** You can sneak up behind a guard and knock them out with your club (usually with the Spacebar). Be aware that this takes a few seconds and makes a noise that can alert nearby guards. A knocked-out guard will eventually wake up in some games, or can be discovered by other guards.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Read the Environment:** Look for clues. Security codes for keypads are often written on pieces of paper or walls within the level. Pay attention to everything.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Locks and Safes:** Lockpicking is a common mini-game. It usually requires you to press a button at the exact moment a pin is in the correct position. This requires good timing.（日本語訳が必要）

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. A guard saw me even though I was in the shadows. Why?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > If a guard walks directly into you, they will detect you even if you are in a shadow. Shadows make you invisible to line-of-sight detection, but not to physical contact.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. How do I get past the laser grids?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > You usually need to find a switch or a control panel somewhere in the level to disable the lasers. Sometimes this involves a small mini-game or just a single interaction.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. I knocked out a guard, but then I got caught. What happened?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > Another guard likely saw the body of the knocked-out guard and raised the alarm. When you knock out a guard, make sure their body is not on another guard's patrol route.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. Is it better to knock out guards or sneak past them?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > Sneaking is almost always the better and safer option. Knocking out guards should be a last resort or used only when you are certain no other guards will discover the body. It's a tool to create an opening, not a primary strategy.
