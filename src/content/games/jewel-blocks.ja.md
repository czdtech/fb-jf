### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Jewel Blocks is a deceptively simple yet highly addictive puzzle game that challenges your spatial planning skills. The objective is to score as many points as possible by fitting various jewel-themed block shapes onto a 10x10 grid. When you form a complete line of blocks, either horizontally or vertically, the line is cleared from the board. The main challenge lies in the fact that the blocks cannot be rotated, so you must think carefully about placement to keep the board from filling up.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Plan Ahead:** You are presented with three block shapes at a time. Before placing the first one, consider how all three might fit on the board. Don't just focus on the immediate placement; think about the space you are leaving for future pieces.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Aim for Combos:** Clearing a single line is good, but clearing multiple lines with a single piece (a "combo") awards significantly more points. Always look for opportunities to complete two or more lines at once.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Keep the Board Open:** Avoid creating single, isolated empty squares, as these can be very difficult to fill. Try to keep your board as open and flexible as possible to accommodate a wide variety of shapes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Don't Rush:** There is no time limit. Take your time to analyze the pieces and the board to find the optimal placement for each block.
