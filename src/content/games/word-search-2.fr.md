The game is played with a simple click-and-drag motion.

### Commandes

- **Use Hints When Needed:** If you're truly stuck on a word, don't be afraid to use a hint if the game provides one. It will usually reveal the location of the word you're looking for.

- **Check All Directions:** Remember that words can be hidden in any of the eight directions. Once you find the first letter of a word, check all adjacent letters to see if they continue the word in any direction.

- **Look for Uncommon Letters:** If a word has an uncommon letter like J, Q, X, or Z, scan the entire grid for that letter first. Since it appears less frequently, it will significantly narrow down the possible locations for that word.

- **Scan Systematically:** Don't just look randomly. Scan the grid row by row, both forwards and backwards, for the first letter of a word on your list. Then do the same for each column.
