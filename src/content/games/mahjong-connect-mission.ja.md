### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mahjong Connect differs from classic mahjong solitaire: you must link matching tiles with a path that bends at most twice (i.e., ≤2 right‑angle turns) without crossing other tiles. Missions add locked tiles, fog, and bombs that require priority handling and clean board management.
