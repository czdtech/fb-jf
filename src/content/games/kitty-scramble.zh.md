### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Kitty Scramble presents themed letter grids (animals, foods, places). Swipe contiguous letters in any direction to form target words; extra words grant coins. Boards escalate with longer words, diagonal paths, and overlapping targets that require flexible pathing and good vocabulary.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Theme scan: Pre‑list likely words from the theme before swiping.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pattern anchors: Look for repeated bigrams/trigrams (TH, ING, EST) to seed paths.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Overlaps: When a word blocks another, find an alternate route using diagonals.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bonus economy: Bank extra words early to save hints for late boards.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Systematic sweep: Scan rows then columns to avoid misses.

### Controls Guide

- Drag across letters to form words; release to submit; use hints sparingly.
