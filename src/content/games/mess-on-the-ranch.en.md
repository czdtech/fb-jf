### Detailed Game Introduction

Mess on the Ranch is a charming organizational puzzle. Herd animals back to pens, place tools in the right sheds, fix broken fence segments, and clear debris — all within move or time limits. Levels emphasize route planning and prioritization.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Pen priority: Secure loose animals first to reduce chaos.
2.  Route loops: Plan loops that handle multiple pickups per pass.
3.  Tool matching: Deliver tools to sheds en route rather than backtracking.
4.  Fence triage: Repair segments that unblock multiple tasks.
5.  Bonus goals: Attempt optional cleanups only with spare moves.
