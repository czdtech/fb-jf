### Detailed Game Introduction

Mini Golf World is a crisp mini‑golf collection with ramps, windmills, and trick rails. Good scores come from precise pace control, smart bank lines, and patient timing on moving hazards.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Cup‑rim pace: Under‑hit near the hole to avoid lip‑outs.
2.  **[DE]** Bank lines: Use ~45° rails to redirect into corners consistently.
3.  **[DE]** Hazard cycles: Watch one full cycle before hitting through moving parts.
4.  **[DE]** Two‑putt logic: Set up a tap‑in instead of risking a wild hole‑in‑one.
5.  **[DE]** Camera scouting: Pan/zoom to pre‑read slopes and hidden rails.

### Controls Guide

- Aim with cursor; pull back to set power; release to putt; reset if stuck.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Why do I rim out?

A: Too much pace or a bad entry angle — slow down and adjust approach.

- Q: Any universal bank tip?

A: Aim slightly inside 45° to compensate for speed loss on rails.

- Q: Is there a stroke limit?

A: Many holes cap strokes; plan two‑putts to stay under par.
