### Detailed Game Introduction

Diwali Lights is a holiday‑themed light‑up puzzle. Activate lamps (diyas) in the correct order or pattern to illuminate designs without crossing rules. Later stages add limited moves, switches, and timing.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Understand rules: Some boards restrict overlaps or require sequences—read objectives first.
2.  Plan routes: Map a path that minimizes backtracking and respects move limits.
3.  Save toggles: Use switches to open multiple goals at once.
4.  Visual groups: Solve one motif at a time to simplify the board.
5.  Retry optimization: Short puzzles reward fast restarts after missteps.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click lamps, switches, or tiles per puzzle rules.
- Undo/Reset if the mode allows.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I keep failing on move limits—why? Your path wastes steps; redraw a shorter route.
- Timed boards? Complete motifs near timers first.
- Are hints available? Often yes; use them sparingly.
