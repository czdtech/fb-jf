### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Understand rules: Some boards restrict overlaps or require sequences—read objectives first.
2.  Plan routes: Map a path that minimizes backtracking and respects move limits.
3.  Save toggles: Use switches to open multiple goals at once.
4.  Visual groups: Solve one motif at a time to simplify the board.
5.  Retry optimization: Short puzzles reward fast restarts after missteps.
