### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Control the Center:** In the opening, use your pawns and pieces to exert control over the central squares (e4, d4, e5, d5). Pieces in the center have more mobility and influence over the game.
2.  **Develop Your Pieces:** Move your knights and bishops off the back rank early in the game. A good rule of thumb is to move a piece to a better square in each of the first few moves. Try not to move the same piece twice in the opening.
3.  **King Safety:** One of the most important principles. Castle your king to safety early on. This move tucks your king away behind a wall of pawns and develops one of your rooks.
4.  **Think Before You Move:** Always check for your opponent's threats before making a move. Ask yourself what your opponent's last move accomplished and what they might do next.
5.  **Know Piece Values:** Understand the relative value of the pieces (Pawn=1, Knight=3, Bishop=3, Rook=5, Queen=9). This will help you make good trades and avoid blunders.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:chess-classic:q-what-is-the-goal-6d35f14b -->
  **Q: What is the goal of chess?**
    *   **A:** The ultimate goal is to checkmate your opponent's king. This means the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and cannot escape capture.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:chess-classic:q-what-is-castling-a21a9b5d -->
  **Q: What is castling?**
    *   **A:** Castling is a special move where you move your king two squares towards a rook, and then place the rook on the other side of the king. It's a great way to protect your king and activate your rook. You can only castle if neither the king nor the rook has moved, and there are no pieces between them.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:chess-classic:q-what-happens-if-no-33cac195 -->
  **Q: What happens if no one can win?**
    *   **A:** The game can end in a draw in several ways, including stalemate (a player has no legal moves, but their king is not in check), agreement between players, or if the same position is repeated three times.
