<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Learn to Fly is a distance launcher about iterative improvement. Launch a penguin down a ramp, control pitch to maximize glide, and use boosters sparingly. Earnings buy better gliders, rockets, and payloads, unlocking new goals and challenge modes across days.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Set launch angle; keep pitch near optimal to maintain speed.
- Trigger boosters only when speed drops or to clear obstacles.
- Spend on speed and glide upgrades first, then utility.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Arrow keys` adjust pitch; `space`/keys for boosters (host dependent).


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Shallow dives regain speed; gentle climbs extend distance.
- Save fuel for late‑flight when drag slows you down.
- Daily goals guide efficient upgrade order.
