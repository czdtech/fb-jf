### Detailed Game Introduction

Perfect Piano is a fast-paced and engaging rhythm game that simulates playing the piano, similar to the popular "Piano Tiles" genre. Notes in the form of tiles fall from the top of the screen, and you must tap them at the precise moment they reach the bottom keyboard line. The game tests your reflexes, timing, and rhythm as you play along to a variety of beautiful and challenging songs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Focus on the Bottom Line:** Don't watch the tiles as they fall from the top. Keep your eyes focused on the target line at the bottom of the screen. This is where you need to react.
2.  **Anticipate the Rhythm:** Listen to the music! The falling tiles are perfectly synced with the song's melody and rhythm. Anticipating the beat will help you time your taps much more accurately.
3.  **Use Multiple Fingers:** For faster sections, don't rely on just one finger. Position your hands as if you were playing a real piano and use multiple fingers to cover the different columns.
4.  **Handle Long Notes:** When you see a long tile, you must press and hold it for its entire duration. Lifting your finger too early counts as a miss.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple taps or clicks.

*   **`Tap` the Notes:** Use your `mouse` or fingers to `click` on the columns as the falling tiles cross the target line at the bottom.
