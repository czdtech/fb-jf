### Detailed Game Introduction

Age of War is a classic 2D side-scrolling strategy game that became widely popular during the Flash game era. The game's core concept is a battle between two bases, one belonging to the player and the other to an AI opponent. The unique and defining feature of the game is its "evolution" mechanic. Players start in the Stone Age (as cavemen) and must earn experience points (XP) to advance through five distinct eras: Stone Age, Middle Ages, Modern Age, and finally, the Future Age. Each evolution not only unlocks more powerful units and defensive turrets but also fully restores your base's health. The ultimate goal is simple: survive the enemy's onslaught and destroy their base.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

Mastering Age of War requires a balance of offense, defense, and strategic timing.

#### 1. Early Game Strategy (Stone Age)
*   **The Caveman Rush:** The most common and effective opening strategy is to spam the cheapest unit, the "Club Man." They are cost-effective and can quickly overwhelm the enemy in the early stages.
*   **Focus on XP:** Your primary goal is to kill enemy units to gain XP as quickly as possible. A strong offensive push helps you earn XP faster, leading to an earlier evolution.
*   **First Turret:** Build the first turret (Sling Shot) as soon as you can afford it. It provides crucial defensive support and helps you conserve units and health while you save up for more powerful troops or your first evolution.

#### 2. Mid-Game Strategy (Middle Ages & Modern Age)
*   **Balanced Army:** Stop spamming only one type of unit. Create a balanced force. Place melee units (knights, infantry) at the front to absorb damage and protect your powerful but fragile ranged units (archers, riflemen) in the back.
*   **When to Evolve:** Timing your evolution is critical. The best time to evolve is when your base health is low, as evolving fully restores it. Alternatively, evolve when you have a clear battlefield advantage to press your attack with superior units. Don't evolve if you are in the middle of a strong push, as it will clear all your units from the field.
*   **Use Your Special Ability:** Each age comes with a powerful special ability (e.g., meteor shower, god's wrath). These have a long cooldown but can turn the tide of a battle. Use them to wipe out a large wave of enemy units or to support your own major offensive.

#### 3. Late Game Strategy (Future Age)
*   **The Super Soldier:** In the Future Age, the "Super Soldier" is one of the most powerful units in the game. They are expensive but incredibly durable and have immense firepower. Saving up for a few of these can create an unstoppable force.
*   **Advanced Turrets:** Fully upgrade your turrets. The final-era turrets deal massive damage and are essential for defending against the enemy's powerful futuristic units.
*   **Final Push:** Coordinate your most powerful units with your special ability for a final, decisive push to destroy the enemy base.

### Controls Guide

The game is controlled almost entirely with the mouse.

*   **Train Units:** Click on the unit icons at the top-left of the screen to train them. You must have enough gold.
*   **Build Turrets:** Click on the empty turret slots on top of your base to open the build menu, then select a turret to construct.
*   **Use Special Ability:** Click the special ability icon on the top-right of the screen when it's ready (not on cooldown).
*   **Evolve:** Click the "Evolve" button at the top-right of the screen once you have accumulated enough XP.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I get XP?**
    *   **A:** You gain Experience Points (XP) every time one of your units kills an enemy unit.

*   **Q: What is the best unit in the game?**
    *   **A:** While it depends on the situation, the "Super Soldier" from the Future Age is widely considered the most powerful all-around unit due to its high health and damage. In the early game, the basic Club Man is the most effective for its cost.

*   **Q: Is it better to build more turrets or train more units?**
    *   **A:** In the early game, a mix is best. One or two turrets provide stable defense, allowing you to save gold for a strong offensive army. In the late game, having fully upgraded turrets is crucial for survival.

*   **Q: Where can I play Age of War now that Flash is gone?**
    *   **A:** Many gaming websites like CrazyGames, Armor Games, and Kongregate now host Age of War using Flash emulators (like Ruffle), making it fully playable in modern web browsers. There are also mobile versions available on iOS and Android app stores.
