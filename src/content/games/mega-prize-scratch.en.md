### Detailed Game Introduction

Mega Prize Scratch simulates a scratch ticket: recover hidden symbols, match patterns, and trigger bonus rounds. Each card is independent; treat the game as light entertainment rather than a strategy challenge.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Budget: Set a small session budget and stick to it.
2.  Pace: Scratch slowly to enjoy reveals; rushing doesn’t change outcomes.
3.  Bonus awareness: Read rules so you know which symbols unlock features.
4.  Stop rules: Quit on win targets or when the budget ends.
5.  Breaks: Step away periodically to avoid impulse spending.
