### Detailed Game Introduction

Dalgona Game is a careful tracing challenge inspired by honeycomb candy. Carve out the stamped shape by following edges; too much pressure or off‑path cuts crack the candy and fail the round.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Slow and steady near corners; speed only on straight segments.
2.  Follow grooves; don’t force turns across the grain.
3.  Watch micro‑cracks; if they spread, lift and re‑approach.
4.  Save tight angles for last after stabilizing long edges.
5.  Manage the timer by alternating quick/slow sections.
