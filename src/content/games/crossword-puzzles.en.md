<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Crossword Puzzles features themed crossword grids that follow common American‑style rules: fill Across and Down answers so every letter cross‑checks. Themes tie together several long answers in each puzzle. Many hosts provide daily rotations and archives. 

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Select a clue and type to fill its entry; use crossings to resolve uncertain letters.  
- Theme entries are usually longer and share a unifying concept—solve these with crossings to unlock large sections. 

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Type A–Z; `arrow keys` navigate; `Backspace` deletes; `Enter`/`Tab` toggles direction or moves to next clue (site‑dependent).

### Tips and Strategies
- Scan for easy fill‑in‑the‑blank clues, plurals, and common abbreviations.  
- Leverage the theme: once you see the pattern, other themers fall faster.  
- Use Check/Reveal sparingly if the site tracks time.
