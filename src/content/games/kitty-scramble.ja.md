### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Kitty Scramble presents themed letter grids (animals, foods, places). Swipe contiguous letters in any direction to form target words; extra words grant coins. Boards escalate with longer words, diagonal paths, and overlapping targets that require flexible pathing and good vocabulary.
