### Detailed Game Introduction

Stack Bounce is a vibrant and addictive 3D arcade game that tests players' timing and reflexes. The game features a bouncing ball that must descend through a helix tower made of colorful, breakable platforms. The objective is to reach the bottom of the tower by smashing through the stacks. However, players must strategically avoid the black, unbreakable sections of the platforms, as hitting them results in an instant game over. With its simple one-touch controls and satisfying destruction physics, Stack Bounce is easy to pick up but challenging to master.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Hold to Smash:** The core mechanic is simple: press and hold the screen or mouse button to make the ball smash through the colored platforms. The longer you hold, the faster you descend.
2.  **[DE]** **Timing Your Release:** The most crucial skill is knowing when to release. As the tower rotates, you must release your hold just before the ball hits a black section. The ball will then bounce harmlessly on the platform until you decide to smash again.
3.  **[DE]** **Build Up Fever Mode:** If you successfully smash through several platforms in a row without stopping, you will build up a power meter. Once full, the ball enters "Fever Mode." In this state, it becomes a fiery projectile that can smash through *any* platform, including the black ones, for a short period. Use this to your advantage to clear difficult sections.
4.  **[DE]** **Patience is a Virtue:** Don't get greedy. It's often better to pause and wait for the right opening than to risk hitting a black platform by rushing. Wait for a long stretch of colored platforms to appear before holding down to build up speed.

### Controls Guide

*   **[DE]** **Desktop/Laptop:** Press and hold the **left mouse button** to smash through platforms. Release the button to stop smashing and let the ball bounce.
*   **[DE]** **Mobile/Tablet:** Press and hold your **finger on the screen** to smash. Lift your finger to stop.
