### Detailed Game Introduction

Quest Bingo takes the timeless fun of classic Bingo and transforms it into an exciting adventure. In this game, you don't just play single rounds; you embark on a journey through a map filled with unique levels. As numbers are called, you'll daub your card to form winning patterns. But you'll also complete quests, use powerful boosters, and collect hidden puzzle pieces to unlock beautiful artwork, adding a layer of progression and discovery to the familiar gameplay.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Bingo Basics:** The core gameplay is classic Bingo. A number is called, and if you have it on your card, you daub it. The goal is to complete a required pattern (like a straight line, four corners, or a specific shape) on your card.
2.  **[DE]** **Pay Attention to Quests:** Each level has a specific goal, such as "Get two Bingos" or "Collect 3 puzzle pieces." Focus on achieving this quest to pass the level and advance on the map.
3.  **[DE]** **Use Boosters Strategically:** As you play, you will charge up powerful boosters. These can give you a significant advantage, such as a free daub on any number, extra coins, or an instant Bingo. Save them for when you really need them to clinch a win.
4.  **[DE]** **Collect Everything:** Keep an eye out for special numbers that may have puzzle pieces or other collectibles attached. Daubing these numbers is key to completing your collections and earning extra rewards.
