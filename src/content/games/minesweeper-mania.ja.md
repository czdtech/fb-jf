### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Minesweeper Mania is a polished version of the timeless single-player logic puzzle, Minesweeper. The objective is to clear a rectangular grid containing hidden mines without detonating any of them. You must use the number clues revealed on the board to deduce where the mines are. Each number tells you how many mines are in the eight adjacent squares. This version offers multiple difficulty levels, providing a fresh challenge for both new players and seasoned veterans.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **The First Click is Free:** Your first click in any game is always safe and will never be a mine. A good start is to click a few times in the corners and center to open up the board.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Learn the Patterns:** The core of Minesweeper is recognizing patterns. If a square says "1" and there is only one unopened square next to it, that square must be a mine. Flag it!
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Use Flags:** When you are certain a square contains a mine, right-click to flag it. This is crucial for keeping track of information and preventing accidental clicks on known mines.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Chord-Clicking for Speed:** Once a numbered square is touching the correct number of flagged mines, you can click on the number itself (often a middle-click or left+right click) to automatically clear all other remaining adjacent squares. This is the fastest way to clear large safe areas.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Process of Elimination:** If you can't find a definite safe square, use logic to eliminate possibilities. Ask yourself, "If this square were a mine, would it make sense with the numbers around it?" This can help you deduce safe squares to click.
