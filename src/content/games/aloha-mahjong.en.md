### Detailed Game Introduction

Aloha Mahjong offers classic mahjong solitaire. Match open tiles to clear stacked layouts, manage limited shuffles/hints, and solve sets without trapping key pairs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Open structures: Free tiles that unlock the most others.
2.  Pair priorities: Clear rare symbols early to prevent deadlocks.
3.  Look ahead: Avoid removing tiles that seal deeper pairs.
4.  Use shuffles sparingly when blocked.
5.  Time vs. accuracy: In timed modes, balance speed with safe picks.

### Controls Guide

- Select matching open tiles to clear them.
- Hints/Shuffles via UI if available.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- No pairs? Use a shuffle if allowed or restart.
- What is an “open” tile? One free on at least one side and not covered.
- Multiple layouts? Usually several, with varying difficulty.
