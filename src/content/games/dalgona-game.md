### Detailed Game Introduction

Dalgona Game is a careful tracing challenge inspired by honeycomb candy. Carve out the stamped shape by following edges; too much pressure or off‑path cuts crack the candy and fail the round.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Slow and steady near corners; speed only on straight segments.
2.  Follow grooves; don’t force turns across the grain.
3.  Watch micro‑cracks; if they spread, lift and re‑approach.
4.  Save tight angles for last after stabilizing long edges.
5.  Manage the timer by alternating quick/slow sections.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to trace the outline; pressure/angle sensitivity varies by build.
- Restart quickly on breaks.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I keep cracking near corners — how to fix?
  
  A: Reduce speed, take wider arcs if allowed, and pause before turning sharply.

- Q: Is pressure modeled?
  
  A: Some builds simulate pressure; gentle drags are safer near delicate edges.

- Q: Any tips for stars/umbrellas?
  
  A: Do long straights first, then carve the tight inner curves last.
