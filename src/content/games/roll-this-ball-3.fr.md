### Detailed Game Introduction

Roll This Ball is a classic and challenging sliding block puzzle designed to test your logic and planning skills. The game presents you with a grid of tiles, some of which are fixed in place, while others can be moved. Your goal is to slide the movable blocks to form a continuous, unbroken path for a ball to roll from its starting point to the goal. It's a simple concept with surprisingly deep and challenging puzzles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **Analyze the Path:** Before you start moving blocks, trace the potential path with your eyes. Identify the key pieces that need to connect the start and end points.
2.  **[FR]** **Work Backwards:** Sometimes it's easier to solve the puzzle by working backwards from the goal tile. Figure out which piece needs to connect to the goal, then which piece needs to connect to that one, and so on, until you reach the start.
3.  **[FR]** **Use Fixed Blocks as Anchors:** The blocks with rivets in them cannot be moved. Use these as fixed points in your path and build your solution around them.
4.  **[FR]** **Aim for the Stars:** Many levels have a star rating. To get all three stars, you typically need to solve the puzzle in the minimum number of moves possible. This requires thinking efficiently and not making any unnecessary slides.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple drag-and-drop or sliding controls.

*   **[FR]** **Move a Block:** Click and drag a movable block to slide it into an adjacent empty space.
