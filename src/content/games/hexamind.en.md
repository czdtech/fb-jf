### Detailed Game Introduction

HexaMind plays on a hexagonal grid with rules about what may touch: colors, numbers, or symbols must satisfy adjacency constraints (e.g., no equal neighbors, or sums along rays). The six‑direction geometry enables rich deductions through fan‑shaped lines and rings.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Constraint hotspots: Start at cells with the most neighbors or strictest rules.
2.  Ring logic: Use ring sums or color counts around a center to bound candidates.
3.  Ray scans: Scan along axial directions for parity/sequence constraints.
4.  Contradiction seeds: Try a candidate on a tight cell and backtrack on conflict.
5.  Pencil rigor: Maintain clean candidate notes to avoid circular mistakes.

### Controls Guide

- Tap to place values/colors; toggle pencil marks; undo/redo.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:hexamind:im-stuck-where-to-look-d8c5a1a2 -->
  Q: I’m stuck — where to look?
  
  A: Revisit high‑degree nodes and ring totals; combine ring and ray constraints.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:hexamind:is-guessing-required-8f5e96ed -->
  Q: Is guessing required?
  
  A: Good sets allow logical solves; when needed, make shallow, reversible assumptions.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:hexamind:how-is-it-different-from-c5ce884b -->
  Q: How is it different from square‑grid puzzles?
  
  A: Six neighbors create stronger ring/ray reasoning that square grids lack.
