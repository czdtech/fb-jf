### Foire aux questions (FAQ)


Wood Block Match is a 10×10‑style block placement game with wooden aesthetics. Each turn you receive a batch of shapes; place them to complete rows/columns and clear space. The session ends when none of the remaining pieces fit — so success is about preserving flexible lanes while engineering multi‑line clears.
- Drag pieces into the grid; rotate if the mode supports it; clear rows/cols score points.

### Commandes

- Undo discipline: If available, undo immediately after a placement that seals pockets.

- Double clears: Build two‑line setups so one piece clears both.

- Hard piece first: When crowded, place the largest/most awkward piece first.

- Pocket planning: Reserve a 2×2 or L‑shaped pocket for awkward triominoes.

- Center breathing room: Keep the board center open; tidy edges to prevent single‑cell traps.
