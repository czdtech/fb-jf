### Detailed Game Introduction

Carrom Clash is a realistic digital version of the beloved tabletop "strike and pocket" game, Carrom. Often described as finger billiards, the game challenges you to use a larger disc, the "striker," to flick your set of assigned pieces (either black or white) into the four corner pockets. The game requires precision, strategy, and a good understanding of angles to outmaneuver your opponent and clear your pieces first.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **The Objective:** Be the first player to pocket all of your pieces (black or white). To win, you must also pocket and "cover" the red Queen.
2.  **[FR]** **Pocketing Your Pieces:** On your turn, you shoot the striker from your baseline. If you successfully pocket one of your own pieces, you get to shoot again.
3.  **[FR]** **The Queen:** The red Queen is a special piece. You can pocket it any time after you've sunk your first piece. However, to secure the points for the Queen, you *must* sink one of your own pieces immediately on the very next shot. This is called "covering the Queen."
4.  **[FR]** **Fouls:** Be careful not to pocket your striker! This is a foul and results in a penalty, where one of your already pocketed pieces is returned to the center of the board.
5.  **[FR]** **Bank Shots:** Use the sides of the board to your advantage. Bouncing the striker off the edges can help you hit pieces that are in difficult positions.

### Controls Guide

*   **[FR]** **Position Striker:** Click and drag the striker left and right along your baseline to position it for your shot.
*   **[FR]** **Aim and Shoot:** Click on the striker and pull back. An aiming line will appear. The further you pull back, the more powerful your shot will be. Release to shoot.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[FR]** **Q: What does it mean to "cover the Queen"?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** After you legally pocket the red Queen, you must successfully pocket one of your own pieces in the immediate next shot of the same turn. If you fail to do so, the Queen is placed back in the center of the board.

*   **[FR]** **Q: What happens if I pocket the striker?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** This is a foul. You will have to place one of your pocketed pieces back onto the board as a penalty, and your turn ends.

*   **[FR]** **Q: What if I pocket my opponent's piece?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** You lose your turn. You only get to shoot again if you pocket one of your own pieces.
