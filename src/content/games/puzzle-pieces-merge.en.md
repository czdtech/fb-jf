### Detailed Game Introduction

Puzzle Pieces Merge offers a serene and innovative twist on the classic jigsaw puzzle. Instead of a static board, this game invites you to drag, drop, and merge puzzle pieces to reveal beautiful, captivating landscapes. The core mechanic involves correctly placing pieces next to each other, at which point they will merge into a larger segment of the final image. With the ability to rotate pieces and use strategic power-ups, it’s a relaxing yet engaging experience for puzzle lovers.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Start with the Edges:** Just like a real-world jigsaw puzzle, a good strategy is to identify and place the edge and corner pieces first. This helps you build a frame for the rest of the image.
2.  **Group by Color:** Look at the pieces you have and try to group them by color or pattern. If you see a lot of blue pieces, they likely belong to the sky. Grouping them mentally will help you tackle one section of the puzzle at a time.
3.  **Rotate for the Perfect Fit:** Don't forget that you can rotate the pieces. If a piece looks like it should fit but doesn't, try rotating it until it aligns perfectly with its neighbors.
4.  **Use Boosters When Stuck:** If you find yourself truly stuck, use one of the available boosters. These power-ups can help by clearing a section, showing you where a piece goes, or providing other assistance to get you past a tricky spot.
