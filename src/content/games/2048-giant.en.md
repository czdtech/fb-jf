### Detailed Game Introduction

2048 Giant is a version of the classic 2048 puzzle game, but played on a larger grid. The goal remains the same: slide numbered tiles to combine them and create the 2048 tile. The larger board offers a new level of challenge and requires more strategic planning.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

The core strategies for 2048 apply here, but need to be adapted for the larger board.

1.  **The Corner Strategy:** Choose one corner and keep your highest value tile there. This is more crucial on a larger board to avoid getting high-value tiles trapped in the middle.
2.  **Limit Movement:** Stick to 2 or 3 directions to keep the tiles organized and predictable. For example, use only the up, down, and right arrows if your corner is on the right side.
3.  **Build Chains:** Arrange tiles in descending order from your chosen corner. This helps in creating chain reactions of merges.
4.  **Plan Ahead:** Think several moves ahead. A larger board means more possibilities and more chances for error.
