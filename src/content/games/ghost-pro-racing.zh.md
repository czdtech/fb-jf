### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Ghost Pro Racing emphasizes hot‑lap consistency against ghost replays. You’ll learn braking points, apex speeds, and throttle pickups while ghost cars show faster lines. Clean inputs and repeatable references beat risky dive‑bombs for stable PBs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Landmarks: Pick fixed track markers for braking/turn‑in; avoid relying on speedometer alone.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Late apex: Turn a beat later to straighten exits and allow earlier throttle.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Trail braking: Bleed brake into early corner to keep front grip (light pressure).
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Exit priority: A good exit onto long straights dwarfs small entry gains.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Ghost study: Follow the ghost’s arc; find where you’re lifting or turning too early.

### Controls Guide

- Steer: A/D or Left/Right.  Throttle/Brake: W/S or Up/Down.  Restart: R.
