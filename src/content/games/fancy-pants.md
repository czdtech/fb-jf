### Overview
Hand‑drawn platforming focused on momentum and flow: build speed on slopes, wall‑jump, and discover secret areas and collectibles.

### How to Play
- Keep momentum by timing jumps at slope exits.
- Use wall‑runs and slides to chain movement.
- Explore side paths for trophies and hidden rooms.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD: move/jump; S/Down to slide; Up to open doors (host dependent).

### Tips
- Don’t mash jump—press at lip/edge for max carry.
- Slides into jumps preserve speed better than flat starts.
- Revisit earlier levels with better mastery to reach secrets.
