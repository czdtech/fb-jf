### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Tower Mania is an engaging and addictive arcade game that challenges your precision and timing. The objective is simple: build the tallest possible tower by carefully stacking blocks one on top of another. Blocks swing back and forth, and you must tap or click at the precise moment to drop them perfectly aligned. Any part of a block that hangs off will be cut away, making the next level smaller and increasing the difficulty. Test your steady hand and keen eye to reach new heights and achieve the ultimate high score!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Timing is Crucial:** The core of the game is timing your tap perfectly. Watch the swinging block and try to release it when it's directly over the center of the block below. Precision is rewarded.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Focus on the Center:** Always aim for the center. Even if you miss slightly, try to keep the main mass of the tower as central as possible to maintain stability.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Adapt to Smaller Blocks:** As you make imperfect drops, the base of your tower will shrink. You'll need to adapt your timing and precision to these smaller targets.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Use Power-ups (if available):** Some versions of Tower Mania might offer power-ups that can help stabilize your tower or give you a perfect drop. Use them strategically when the tower gets very high and unstable.
