### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Sequel shifts the loop: no power doors, but you manage a Freddy mask and a music box for the Puppet while watching hallways and vents.

### How to Play
- Keep the music box wound via the camera; failure releases the Puppet.
- Use the Freddy mask when certain animatronics enter the office.
- Flashlight checks the hallway and stuns Foxy briefly.

### Controls
- Mouse/UI for cameras and mask; Ctrl/Space for flashlight (host dependent).

### Tips
- Build a loop: wind box → lower cam → hallway flash → vent lights → mask on if needed.
- Don’t over‑flash; conserve battery for hallway checks.
- Recognize which characters require the mask versus lights.

### FAQ
- Q: Why am I losing to the Puppet?  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Camera time too long elsewhere; prioritize winding the box.
- Q: When do I use the mask?  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Immediately when an animatronic is in the office (not in vents/hall).
- Q: Is there door control?  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: No—FNAF 2 relies on mask, vents, and flashlight management.
