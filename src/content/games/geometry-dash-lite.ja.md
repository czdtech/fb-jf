### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Entry version of the rhythm platformer: clear curated levels with jump pads, gravity portals, and ship sections synced to music.

### How to Play
- Tap/jump on the beat to pass spikes and saws.
- Hold to fly the ship smoothly; keep altitude steady.
- Memorize tricky segments and practice mode if available.

### Controls
- Space/Mouse/Touch to jump; hold to fly; practice toggles vary by host.

### Tips
- Turn on practice for tough sections to set checkpoints.
- Use music cues to predict upcoming jumps.
