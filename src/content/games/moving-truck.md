### Game Introduction

"Moving Truck" is a physics-based puzzle game. Players' task is to strategically load furniture and various items of different shapes and sizes into a moving truck, ensuring that the items remain balanced and secure during transit, and ultimately arrive safely at their destination. The game challenges players' spatial reasoning and planning abilities.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Observe Item Shapes**: Carefully examine the shape and size of each item to be moved, envisioning how they can be best stacked and combined.
2.  **Plan Loading Order**: Prioritize loading large, regularly shaped items as bottom supports, placing smaller or fragile items on top or in gaps.
3.  **Maintain Balance**: During loading, pay attention to the truck's center of gravity, trying to distribute items evenly to prevent the truck from tipping or overturning.
4.  **Utilize Physics**: Sometimes items may slide or roll due to physics; you need to cleverly utilize or secure them beforehand.
5.  **Repeated Attempts**: Some levels may require multiple attempts to find the most perfect loading solution.

### How to Play

*   **Pick Up Items**: Click on an item to pick it up.
*   **Place Items**: Drag the item to a suitable position inside the truck, then release the mouse to place it down.
*   **Rotate Items**: Some game versions might offer a function to rotate items for better fit (usually via mouse scroll wheel or specific keys).

### Frequently Asked Questions

    **A**: The objective is to successfully load all items into the truck and maintain its balance during transit, ultimately delivering them safely to the destination.
2.  **Q: What happens if items fall out of the truck?**
    **A**: If items fall off the truck during transit, it usually results in task failure, requiring you to retry the level.
3.  **Q: Is there a time limit in the game?**
    **A**: Some levels might have a time limit, requiring players to complete loading and transit within a specified time.
4.  **Q: How can I improve my loading skills?**
    **A**: Practice spatial planning and item stacking, observe successful examples, and try different loading strategies.
