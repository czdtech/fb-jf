### Detailed Game Introduction

Backyard Zombie Defense is a lightweight TD: build and upgrade a mix of single‑target and aoe turrets, slow enemies near exits, and pace economy to keep up with scaling waves.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Cover long paths and shared lanes for efficiency.
2.  Slow + splash near exits to catch leaks.
3.  Early upgrades on high‑impact towers compound value.
4.  Balance damage types for fast vs. tanky zombies.
5.  Save cash for mid‑wave emergencies when needed.

### Controls Guide

- Place/Upgrade/Sell via UI; start waves when ready.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Keep leaking—what to do? Add slows and aoe at choke/exits; upgrade key towers.
- Best openers? One strong early tower covering long lanes.
- Speed toggle? Many versions include fast‑forward.
