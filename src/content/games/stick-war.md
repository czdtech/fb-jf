### Game Introduction

Stick War is one of the most popular and highly-rated web games of all time. It is a real-time strategy game where you take command of the "Order" nation. In a world called Inamorta, where nations are devoted to their individual technologies, you must build a powerful army, destroy the enemy's statue, and conquer all territories.

### Gameplay Guide

The core of the game revolves around managing resources and commanding your army.
- **Economy:** You must train Miners to gather gold, which is the resource used to create units and purchase upgrades.
- **Army Building:** Train a variety of units, including basic Swordwrath, ranged Archidons, tank-like Speartons, powerful Giants, and spell-casting Magikill.
- **Combat:** You can command your army to attack or defend. A key feature is the ability to take direct control of any unit, significantly boosting its power and allowing for precise maneuvers. The ultimate goal is to destroy the enemy statue on the far side of the map.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse:** Used to select units, click buttons to train soldiers, and direct your army.
- **Movement (when controlling a unit):** `A` and `D` keys.
- **Attack (when controlling a unit):** `Spacebar`.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is the best starting strategy?**

A common and effective strategy is to immediately build a few Miners to establish a strong gold income. Then, train a single Swordwrath, take control of it, and use it to defend against the first wave of enemies while your economy grows.

**Which units should I use?**

A balanced army is key. Speartons are excellent for defense and absorbing arrow fire, while Archidons deal high damage from a distance. Swordwrath are cheap and good against archers. Magikill and Giants are powerful late-game units that can turn the tide of a major battle.

**What should I upgrade first?**

It is highly recommended to spend your first upgrade points on your Miners' bags and your statue's income to accelerate your economy. After that, focus on upgrading the units you use most often.
