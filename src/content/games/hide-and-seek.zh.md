### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Hide and Seek! adapts playground tag into top‑down stealth. Hiders blend among NPCs, gather items, and finish objectives while avoiding the seeker’s patrol. As the seeker, you watch movement patterns, use sprints or gadgets, and flush out suspicious players before the timer ends.

### How to Play
- As a hider: move with the crowd, complete tasks, and break line‑of‑sight when chased.
- As a seeker: learn map chokepoints, check objectives, and react to odd pathing.
- Power‑ups provide short invisibility, speed, or reveals depending on mode.

### Controls
- WASD/Arrows to move; action key for power‑ups (host dependent).

### Tips
- Hiders: mimic NPC pauses and turns; sprint only when necessary.
- Seekers: circle objectives; real players hesitate at corners and doors.
- Use audio/visual tells like sudden direction changes.
