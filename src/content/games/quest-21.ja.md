### Detailed Game Introduction
5.  **Blackjack:** If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card, you have a "Blackjack" and typically win the hand instantly.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Quest 21 is a fun and strategic card game adventure based on the rules of classic Blackjack. Instead of just playing at a casino table, you embark on a quest, facing off against a series of opponents. To defeat them and advance, you must win hands of 21. The goal in each hand is to get a card total closer to 21 than your opponent without going over. It combines the luck of the draw with simple, strategic decisions.
The game is played with on-screen buttons.（日本語訳が必要）

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

- **Q: What does it mean to "bust"?**（日本語訳が必要）
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **The Goal:** Get your hand total as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it. A hand over 21 is a "bust" and an automatic loss.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Card Values:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   Cards 2-10 are worth their face value.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   Aces are special: they can be worth either 1 or 11, whichever is more beneficial to your hand.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Hit or Stand?** On your turn, you have two main choices:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Hit:** Take another card to try and get closer to 21.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Stand:** Keep your current hand and end your turn.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Basic Strategy:** A simple rule of thumb is to always "Hit" if your hand total is 11 or less. If your hand is 17 or more, it is usually wise to "Stand," as the risk of busting is high.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Blackjack:** If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10-value card, you have a "Blackjack" and typically win the hand instantly.
