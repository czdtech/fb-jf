### Detailed Game Introduction

Rampage Road mixes top‑down driving with arcade shooting. Navigate traffic, manage ammo or cooldowns, and eliminate targets while keeping your vehicle intact through waves of enemies.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Clean lines: Hug lanes with predictable gaps to avoid traffic hits.
2.  Burst fire: Short controlled bursts conserve ammo and heat.
3.  Focus targets: Remove dangerous foes (rockets/rammers) first.
4.  Collect wisely: Grab pickups when safe; don’t cut across heavy traffic.
5.  Escape tools: Save boosts or shields for emergencies.

### Controls Guide

- Drive: A/D or Left/Right; accelerate/brake with W/S or Up/Down.
- Fire: Click/Space per mode; secondary with another key if present.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I explode fast—why? You’re trading hits in traffic; prioritize avoidance over kills.
- Ammo limited? Many modes—use bursts and time reloads.
- Boss fights? Some waves escalate; prepare boosts and space.
