<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Detailed Game Introduction

Categories is a light logic game about sorting items into thematic groups. Identify common links, separate decoys, and solve sets under light timers or move limits.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Easy sets first: Lock obvious groups to shrink the search space.
2.  Test swaps: Move borderline items between plausible groups.
3.  Spot decoys: Items that seem to fit many groups are often misleads.
4.  Manage time: Don’t tunnel—cycle candidates quickly.
5.  Confirm with opposites: If two categories are close, define them by what they exclude.
