### Detailed Game Introduction

Categories is a light logic game about sorting items into thematic groups. Identify common links, separate decoys, and solve sets under light timers or move limits.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Easy sets first: Lock obvious groups to shrink the search space.
2.  Test swaps: Move borderline items between plausible groups.
3.  Spot decoys: Items that seem to fit many groups are often misleads.
4.  Manage time: Don’t tunnel—cycle candidates quickly.
5.  Confirm with opposites: If two categories are close, define them by what they exclude.

### Controls Guide

- Drag items into groups or tap to assign per UI.
- Undo/Reset where available.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Are there multiple solutions? Usually one; follow intended themes.
- Hints? Many versions provide hints—use sparingly.
- Timed? Often light timers to keep pace brisk.
