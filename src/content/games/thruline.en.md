### Detailed Game Introduction

Thruline tasks you with tracing one unbroken path that visits all required nodes while obeying rules about turns, crossings, and coverage. Later grids add gates, bridges, and parity tricks that reward early bottleneck placement.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Bottlenecks first: Claim narrow corridors before they close.
2.  Turn budgeting: Minimize turns on long runs; save them for tight corners.
3.  Bridge logic: Cross only on provided bridges; treat them as limited resources.
4.  Early backtrack: Undo as soon as isolation appears.
5.  Symmetry exploitation: Mirror partial solutions in symmetric layouts.
