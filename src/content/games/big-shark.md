### Detailed Introduction

*Big Shark* is a fast-paced, 2D underwater survival game with a simple yet addictive premise: eat or be eaten. Players take control of a shark and navigate a vast ocean teeming with life and danger. The primary objective is to survive for as long as possible and grow to be the biggest shark in the sea by consuming other marine life.

You start as a relatively small shark, only able to eat the smallest of fish. As you consume prey, you gain points and gradually increase in size. This growth is key, as it allows you to hunt and eat progressively larger creatures, from medium-sized fish to other sharks and even unsuspecting swimmers. However, the ocean is a dangerous place. You must constantly be on the lookout for threats, such as sharks larger than you, deadly sea mines, and other hazards that can end your run instantly. The game is an endless arcade experience focused on achieving the highest possible score.

### Gameplay Strategy

Success in *Big Shark* depends on a mix of aggression and caution.

1.  **Be Cautious at the Start:** When you are small, you are extremely vulnerable. Focus exclusively on eating the smallest fish and actively avoid everything else. Don't get greedy; survival is your top priority in the early stages.
2.  **Know Your Prey:** You can only eat creatures that are smaller than you. The game usually provides a clear visual cue. If something is your size or larger, it's either a competitor or a threat.
3.  **Use Your Boost Wisely:** Most versions of the game give you a speed boost ability. This is your most important tool for both offense and defense.
    *   **For Offense:** Use the boost to quickly close the distance and catch faster-moving prey.
    *   **For Defense:** The boost is your lifeline for escaping larger sharks that are chasing you. Don't waste it, and try to have it ready for emergencies.
4.  **Memorize the Threats:**
    *   **Bigger Sharks:** The most common threat. Touching one means an instant game over. Always give them a wide berth.
    *   **Sea Mines:** These explosive devices are often stationary. Colliding with one is fatal. Be especially careful when boosting through crowded areas.
    *   **Jellyfish:** In some versions, these can sting you, causing you to lose points or get temporarily stunned.
5.  **Chain Your Kills for More Points:** To get a high score, try to eat multiple fish in quick succession. This often creates a combo bonus, multiplying your points and helping you grow faster.

### Controls Guide

The controls for *Big Shark* are designed to be simple and intuitive, primarily using the mouse.

*   **Movement:** Your shark automatically follows the position of your mouse cursor on the screen.
*   **Boost / Dash:** Press the **Left Mouse Button** to activate a short burst of speed. This usually consumes some of your score or has a cooldown period.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. How do I grow bigger in the game?**
You grow by eating. The more fish and other creatures you consume, the larger your shark will become, allowing you to eat even bigger prey.

**2. Why did my game end suddenly?**
You most likely ran into a threat you couldn't eat. The most common reasons for a game over are colliding with a shark larger than you or hitting a sea mine.

**3. Is there an end to the game?**
No, *Big Shark* is an endless game. The goal is not to "win" but to survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score you can.

**4. What is the best way to get a high score?**
The key to a high score is staying alive long enough to grow very large. Once you are big, you can eat almost anything, which allows you to rack up points quickly. Focus on survival first, and the high score will follow.

**5. Can I eat the swimmers?**
Yes, but only once you have grown large enough. They are usually one of the higher-tier prey and award a significant number of points.
