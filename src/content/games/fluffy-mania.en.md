### Detailed Game Introduction

Fluffy Mania is a colorful, relaxing connect‑puzzle. Link adjacent same‑color fluffies to clear them, set up chain reactions, and complete stage goals like score targets, limited moves, or special tile clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Make squares: If rules allow loops/squares, they usually clear all of that color—huge value.
2.  Save long chains: Don’t waste large groups early; use them to finish strict goals.
3.  Work from bottom: Bottom clears create natural cascades above.
4.  Think two moves ahead: Avoid isolating single tiles that clog progress.
5.  Power‑ups: Trigger them when they open multiple goals at once.

### Controls Guide

- Connect: Click/tap and drag through same‑color neighbors.
- Undo/Retry (if available): Use with care on limited‑move stages.
