### Overview
Frontiers refines the Kingdom Rush formula with new biomes, enemy abilities, and tower specializations. Place archer, barracks, mage, and artillery towers, then branch them into unique specials. Call reinforcements, drop meteor‑like specials, and micro your hero to plug leaks while managing armor/magic resist counters.

### How to Play
- Identify armor types; use mages vs. armored foes, archers/artillery vs. swarms.
- Position barracks to stall at choke points; support with splash or magic.
- Save hero skills and nukes for elite waves or flying rushes.

### Controls
- Mouse/touch to build, upgrade, and cast; hotkeys vary by host.

### Tips
- Don’t overbuild early—upgrade key towers for efficient damage.
- Split splash and single‑target to handle mixed waves.
- Scout flying paths; add anti‑air where needed.

### FAQ
- Q: Which tower upgrades should I prioritize?  
  A: One or two core towers to tier‑3/4 near the main choke beat many small towers.
- Q: How do I counter heavy armor waves?  
  A: Invest in mage lines and armor‑shredding skills.
- Q: Are heroes necessary to win?  
  A: Not required but very helpful for stalling and finishing elites.
