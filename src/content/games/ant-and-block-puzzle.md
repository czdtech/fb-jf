### Detailed Game Introduction

Ant and block puzzle is a casual shape‑placement challenge. Fit given blocks into a board, complete rows/areas to clear space, and stave off top‑outs with efficient packing.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Reserve corners for L/T shapes.
2.  Leave flexible gaps sized for common small pieces.
3.  Don’t build tall narrow wells without a matching piece.
4.  Prioritize clears that open board center.
5.  Undo early when placements feel forced.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to place; rotate if the mode supports it.
- Undo/Reset via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- No fits left—what now? Use undo or restart with a different opening.
- Rotations? Depends on variant; check the UI.
- Endless? Many versions are score‑chasing.
