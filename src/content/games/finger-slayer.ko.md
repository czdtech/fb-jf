### Detailed Game Introduction

Finger Slayer is a single‑button reflex test: place your “finger” within a danger zone and yank it away right before a trap snaps shut. Rounds escalate with faster closures, fake telegraphs, and rhythm changes that punish anticipation. The goal is to commit to a single crisp pull at the last safe frame without flinching early (which scores lower) or waiting too long.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Read the tell: Most traps give a micro‑windup (sound/visual); key off that signal, not a mental count.
2.  **[KO]** Don’t pre‑move: Early flinches reduce score and rhythm; stay still until the tell.
3.  **[KO]** One clean pull: Make the exit decisive — partial drags get clipped.
4.  **[KO]** Rhythm adaptation: After a few rounds, patterns shift; reset mentally between attempts.
5.  **[KO]** Safe thresholds: Learn your personal reaction boundary and aim a hair earlier.

### Controls Guide

- Hold to “place” and release to pull back; some builds use tap vs hold.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I always move too early — how do I stop?

A: Focus on the trap’s pre‑animation or audio cue; suppress guessing and react to the real tell.

- Q: Closures feel random — any tip?

A: They’re pseudo‑random with patterned “tells.” Train a calm wait‑then‑snap reaction.

- Q: Is there input lag?

A: Minor delays exist on some devices; compensate by reacting on the cue’s first frame.
