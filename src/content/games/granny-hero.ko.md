### Detailed Game Introduction

Granny Hero is a lighthearted runner where a spry granny dashes through streets, avoids slapstick hazards, and collects items to aid neighbors. Expect lane swaps, jump/slide timing, and occasional gadgets (scooters, umbrellas, pans) that grant brief invulnerability or crowd‑control.
