### Game Introduction

"Only Up" is an extremely challenging 3D platformer. Players' objective is to continuously climb a massive world composed of various floating objects, abandoned buildings, and peculiar structures. The game has no save points; every mistake can lead to falling from great heights, requiring a restart from the beginning, thus posing a significant test to players' precision and mental fortitude.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Meticulous Observation**: Before each jump, carefully observe the position, distance, and material of the next landing spot, and plan the optimal route.
2.  **Master Jump Rhythm**: Different objects may require different jump strengths and timings; familiarize yourself with the character's jumping feel.
3.  **Utilize Environment**: Some seemingly impossible jumps might require using small objects in the environment for assistance, or finding hidden paths.
4.  **Stay Calm**: Don't get discouraged by multiple failures; staying calm helps improve operational stability and precision.
5.  **Learn from Experience**: Every fall is an opportunity to learn; remember where you failed to avoid repeating mistakes.

### How to Play

*   **Movement**: Use WASD or arrow keys to control character movement.
*   **Jump**: Spacebar for jumping.
*   **Sprint**: Some game versions may offer a sprint function, often combined with jumping for longer leaps (e.g., Shift + Spacebar).
*   **Camera Control**: Use the mouse to control the camera, allowing for better observation of the surroundings and route planning.
