### Detailed Game Introduction

Color Jump is a minimalist reflex game where your character can pass only through matching‑color gates or platforms. Time jumps to align colors, avoid mismatched barriers, and maintain rhythm as speed increases.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Read two obstacles ahead; don’t fixate on the nearest gate.
2.  **[KO]** Keep a steady tap cadence; late jumps often dodge low obstacles better.
3.  **[KO]** Skip risky coins when alignment is off.
4.  **[KO]** Practice color order patterns if they loop.
5.  **[KO]** Use sound cues to stabilize timing on dense sets.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click to jump; some variants allow double jumps.
- Pause/Restart via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I always hit the wrong color — any fix?

A: Focus on the next two gates and time jumps slightly later to line up with high platforms.

- Q: Is there an end?

A: Often endless; set personal bests.

- Q: Double jump?

A: Some builds include it; watch the tutorial prompt.
