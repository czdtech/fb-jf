### Detailed Game Introduction

Letter Links is a strategic word-building game that shares similarities with Scrabble. Each day, you are given a new set of letter tiles, each with a point value. Your goal is to place these tiles on a game board to form valid, interconnected words, much like a crossword puzzle. By strategically utilizing high-value letters and special bonus squares on the board, you aim to achieve the highest possible score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Know Your Bonuses:** The key to a high score is using the bonus squares effectively.
    *   **[DE]** **DL (Double Letter):** Doubles the point value of the letter placed on it.
    *   **[DE]** **TL (Triple Letter):** Triples the point value of the letter placed on it.
    *   **[DE]** **DW (Double Word):** Doubles the score of the entire word that uses this square.
    *   **[DE]** **TW (Triple Word):** Triples the score of the entire word that uses this square.

2.  **[DE]** **Build Around the Center:** The game requires that the center star square must be occupied. Start your first word there.
3.  **[DE]** **Create Overlaps:** Don't just build one long word. The best way to score is to make a move that forms multiple words at once. For example, placing a tile that simultaneously completes a horizontal word and forms a new vertical word.
4.  **[DE]** **Use High-Value Letters Wisely:** Save your high-value letters (like Z, Q, J, X) to be placed on bonus squares like DL, TL, DW, or TW to maximize their impact.

### Controls Guide

*   **[DE]** **Place Tiles:** Click and drag a letter tile from your rack at the bottom to a square on the game board.
*   **[DE]** **Recall Tiles:** You can drag a placed tile back to your rack before submitting if you change your mind.
*   **[DE]** **Submit:** Once you have placed your tiles, click the "Submit Words" button to lock them in and calculate your score.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: Why was my word rejected?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** There are a few possibilities: 1) It's not a valid word in the game's dictionary. 2) Not all of your placed tiles are connected in a single group. 3) The center star square was not used.

*   **[DE]** **Q: How are points calculated?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The score for a word is the sum of the values of its letters, multiplied by any word bonuses (DW, TW). Letter bonuses (DL, TL) are applied to individual letters before the word multipliers.

*   **[DE]** **Q: Can I play diagonally?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** No. All words must be formed horizontally (left-to-right) or vertically (top-to-bottom).
