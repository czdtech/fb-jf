### Detailed Game Introduction

Diamond Rush is a dazzling and addictive match-3 puzzle game that challenges your quick thinking and matching skills. The objective is to swap adjacent diamonds to create lines of three or more identical gems, clearing them from the board and earning points. With vibrant graphics, sparkling animations, and engaging sound effects, Diamond Rush offers a classic match-3 experience with a focus on fast-paced gameplay and high scores. Race against the clock or complete specific objectives to progress through exciting levels.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Look for Special Gem Combinations:** Matching four or five diamonds, or creating L/T shapes, will generate powerful special gems (like line clearers or bombs). These are crucial for clearing large sections of the board and achieving high scores.
2.  **Prioritize Objectives:** Each level often has specific objectives, such as reaching a certain score, clearing specific types of diamonds, or breaking through obstacles. Focus your moves on achieving these goals efficiently.
3.  **Combine Special Gems:** The most effective way to clear the board and overcome tough challenges is by combining two special gems. Experiment with different combinations to see their powerful effects.
4.  **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the board can cause a cascade effect, where new diamonds fall into place and potentially create new matches automatically. This can be a great way to rack up points and clear the board.
5.  **Time Management (if applicable):** If the level has a time limit, try to make quick, efficient matches. Don't spend too much time deliberating over a single move.

### Controls Guide

*   **Swap Diamonds:** Use your mouse to click and drag a diamond to an adjacent position to swap it with another. This action is only valid if it results in a match of three or more identical diamonds.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
