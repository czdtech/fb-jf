### Game Introduction

"Trap the Cat" is a strategic puzzle game where players must block a clever cat's escape routes by placing barriers on a hexagonal grid, using logic and planning to prevent the cat from reaching the edge. This game tests players' prediction abilities and strategic thinking.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Center Control**: Try to place barriers around the cat first, gradually shrinking its movement area.
2.  **Path Analysis**: Observe the cat's possible escape routes and prioritize blocking the shortest paths.
3.  **Edge Defense**: Pay attention to protecting the grid edges to prevent the cat from finding breakthrough points.
4.  **Predict Movement**: The cat will choose optimal paths; predict its next movement direction.
5.  **Encirclement Strategy**: Form a complete encirclement without leaving any escape gaps.

### How to Play

*   **Place Barriers**: Click on hexagonal cells to place obstacles.
*   **Observe Cat**: Watch the cat's current position and possible movement directions.
*   **Restart**: If you fail, you can restart the challenge.

### Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Q: How does the cat move?**
    **A**: The cat intelligently chooses the shortest path to the edge, moving one step per turn.
2.  **Q: Is there a time limit?**
    **A**: Usually no time limit; you can carefully consider each placement.
3.  **Q: Is there a limit to the number of obstacles?**
    **A**: Yes, you need to successfully trap the cat within a limited number of moves, adding strategic difficulty.
4.  **Q: How can I improve success rate?**
    **A**: Practice observing the cat's behavior patterns and learn to predict the most effective blocking positions.
