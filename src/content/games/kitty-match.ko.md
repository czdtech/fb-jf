### Detailed Game Introduction

Kitty Match is a charming and addictive match-3 puzzle game filled with cute cats and colorful challenges. The goal is to swap adjacent tiles to create lines of three or more identical items. Each level has a unique objective, such as collecting a certain number of specific items or clearing special blocks. By completing levels, you can earn rewards and progress through a delightful, cat-filled world. It's a relaxing game for all ages, perfect for puzzle and cat lovers alike.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Look for Big Matches:** While matching three items is good, matching four or five items is even better! These larger matches create special power-up tiles that can clear entire rows, columns, or explode to clear a whole area.
2.  **[KO]** **Plan Your Moves:** You only have a limited number of moves in each level. Before making a swap, look at the whole board and try to plan a few moves ahead. Prioritize matches that will help you achieve the level's goal.
3.  **[KO]** **Combine Power-ups:** The real magic happens when you combine two special power-up tiles. Swapping a bomb with a rocket, for example, can create a massive board-clearing effect. Experiment with different combinations.
4.  **[KO]** **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the board can cause a cascade of new tiles to fall, often creating new matches automatically. This is a great way to clear the board efficiently.

### Controls Guide

*   **[KO]** **Swap Tiles:** Use your mouse to click and drag an item to an adjacent tile to swap their positions. You can only swap if the move results in a match of three or more.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[KO]** **Q: What is the goal of each level?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** Each level has a specific goal, which is displayed at the start. This could be collecting a certain number of a specific colored item, breaking all the jelly squares, or bringing special items down to the bottom of the board.

*   **[KO]** **Q: What happens if I run out of moves?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** If you cannot complete the level's objective before you run out of moves, you will lose a life and have to try the level again.

*   **[KO]** **Q: How do I create a bomb?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** You can typically create a bomb power-up by matching five identical items in an "L" or "T" shape. Bombs clear a large area of tiles around them when activated.
