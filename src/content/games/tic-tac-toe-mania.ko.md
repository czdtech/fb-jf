### Detailed Game Introduction

Tic Tac Toe Mania modernizes noughts‑and‑crosses with clean visuals and variants (bigger boards, misère). Core play is about forcing lines or neutralizing threats; perfect 3×3 play draws unless a mistake occurs.

2.  **[KO]** Block immediately: Always respond to a two‑in‑a‑row.
3.  **[KO]** Create forks: Set up positions where two lines can win next.
4.  **[KO]** Anti‑fork: Play to break opponent fork patterns.
5.  **[KO]** Variants: On larger boards, prioritize flexible lines over early corners.

### Controls Guide

- Click squares to place marks; local 2P common; AI difficulties vary.
