### Detailed Game Introduction

Idle Restaurants is a classic idle management game that puts you in charge of building a culinary empire from the ground up. You start with a small, humble diner and must strategically invest your earnings to grow your business. By upgrading your tables, chefs, and waiters, you can increase your efficiency and profits. The ultimate goal is to automate your workflow by hiring managers and expand your enterprise by opening new, more profitable restaurants.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Restaurant Workflow:** Understand the flow of money. Customers arrive and are seated -> The chef prepares their order -> The waiter delivers the food -> The customer pays. Each step in this chain can be upgraded.
2.  **Balanced Upgrades:** To maximize your income, you need a balanced operation. It's no use having super-fast chefs if you don't have enough tables for customers, or if your waiters are too slow to deliver the food. Try to upgrade your tables, kitchen, and waiters in tandem.
3.  **Automate Everything:** The key to an idle game is making money while you're away. As soon as you can, hire managers for each station. The manager will automatically collect earnings for you, ensuring a constant stream of income.
4.  **Know When to Expand:** Your long-term goal is to save up enough money to open a new restaurant. Each new restaurant you unlock will have a much higher earning potential than the last. Once upgrades in your current restaurant become very expensive, it's time to focus on saving for the next one.
