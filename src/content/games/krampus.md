### Overview
Krampus is a seasonal horror platformer featuring dimly lit stages, environmental traps, and pursuit segments. Explore to find keys, switches, and safe routes while evading eerie creatures. Limited visibility and sound cues create tension, rewarding cautious movement and observation.

### How to Play
- Move slowly, scout trap patterns, and memorize safe platforms.
- Find keys/switches to unlock gates; some items grant brief safety.
- If chased, use verticality and doors to break line‑of‑sight.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; action/interact keys vary by host.

### Tips
- Watch for glints or subtle lights that mark items and exits.
- Wait out patrols rather than forcing risky jumps.
- Sound cues (growls, steps) telegraph danger—pause and listen.

### FAQ

- Q: Can I fight the monsters in this game?

- Q: Are there checkpoints in stages?
