### Game Introduction

"Stickman Hook" is a physics-based swinging game where players control a stickman character, using grappling hooks to swing through levels, avoiding obstacles and performing acrobatic moves to reach the finish line. The game is widely popular for its smooth swinging mechanics and addictive physics gameplay.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **[KO]** **Timing Mastery**: Learn to release and grab hooks at the right moments to maintain optimal swinging rhythm.
2.  **[KO]** **Momentum Utilization**: Use swinging momentum to gain greater speed and jumping distance.
3.  **[KO]** **Chain Swinging**: Use multiple hook points consecutively to maintain speed and height.
4.  **[KO]** **Obstacle Prediction**: Observe obstacles ahead and plan safe swinging routes.
5.  **[KO]** **Acrobatic Performance**: Try performing flips and spins for added fun.

### How to Play

*   **[KO]** **Grapple**: Click or hold to fire the hook and grab onto anchor points.
*   **[KO]** **Release**: Release the button to let go of the hook and use inertia to continue forward.
*   **[KO]** **Swing**: Use physics swinging mechanics to gain momentum and direction.

### Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **[KO]** **Q: How do I get more swinging power?**
**A**: Release the hook at the lowest point of the swing to use gravitational acceleration for maximum momentum.
2.  **[KO]** **Q: Why do I often hit obstacles?**
**A**: You need to plan your path ahead and release/re-grab hooks at appropriate times.
3.  **[KO]** **Q: How do I perform continuous swinging?**
**A**: Grab the next anchor point just as one swing is about to end to maintain continuity.
4.  **[KO]** **Q: How many levels are in the game?**
**A**: Usually contains dozens of levels, each with different challenges and obstacle layouts.
