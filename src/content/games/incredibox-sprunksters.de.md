This isn't your standard Incredibox vibe; it's a super creative mod crafted by the awesome Bismeowth, blending the quirky spirit of Sprunki with music making in a way that opens up endless possibilities!

### So, What's the Lowdown on Incredibox Sprunksters?

Basically, Incredibox Sprunksters is your ticket to a musical adventure where you get to compose beats using a crew of seriously stylish characters. It keeps the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop gameplay – pick a character, drop 'em on stage, let 'em do their thing – but injects it with a whole new Sprunksters flavour. The best part? There are no wrong notes here, just pure creative freedom to experiment and mash up awesome sound combos.

### How to Get Down with Incredibox Sprunksters?
