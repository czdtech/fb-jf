### Detailed Game Introduction

Pocket Battle Royale is a fast-paced, top-down 2D shooter that distills the excitement of the battle royale genre into quick, action-packed rounds. You are dropped into a maze-like arena with other players and must fight to be the last one standing. Scavenge for weapons, ammo, and health packs while staying ahead of the ever-shrinking safe zone that forces players closer together. It’s a pure test of survival, reflexes, and strategy.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Loot Quickly:** Your first priority when the game starts is to find a weapon. Run through the buildings and open areas to find guns, ammo, and health kits. You are defenseless without a weapon.
2.  **[ES]** **Stay Aware of Your Surroundings:** The top-down perspective allows you to see enemies coming from all directions. Keep moving and use corners and obstacles as cover. Don't stand out in the open for too long.
3.  **[ES]** **Watch the Safe Zone:** Always be aware of where the safe zone is and where it will shrink next. A timer will indicate when the zone will start closing in. Getting caught outside the zone will drain your health rapidly.
4.  **[ES]** **Pick Your Fights:** You don't have to engage every enemy you see. Sometimes it's smarter to let other players fight each other while you loot and get into a better position for the final showdown.

### Controls Guide

*   **[ES]** **Movement:** Use the **WASD keys** to move your character up, left, down, and right.
*   **[ES]** **Aim:** Your character will automatically aim in the direction of your **mouse cursor**.
*   **[ES]** **Shoot:** Click the **left mouse button** to fire your weapon.
