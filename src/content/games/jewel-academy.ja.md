### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Jewel Academy is a rich and polished match-3 puzzle game that invites players to a world of colorful gems and magical challenges. As a student of the academy, you will progress through a vast map of levels, each with a unique objective. The core gameplay involves swapping adjacent jewels to create lines of three or more of the same color. By making strategic matches, you can create powerful special gems, overcome tricky obstacles, and solve hundreds of engaging puzzles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Look for Special Combos:** Don't just settle for matching three. Actively look for opportunities to match four or five jewels, as this is the key to creating powerful power-ups that can clear large sections of the board.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Combine Power-ups:** The most effective way to clear difficult levels is by combining special jewels. For example, swapping an Arrow jewel with a Bomb jewel will clear three rows and three columns simultaneously. Swapping two Color Bombs together will clear the entire board!
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Focus on the Objective:** Always keep the level's goal in mind. If you need to clear certain blocked tiles, focus your matches in those areas. If you need to drop special items to the bottom, clear the jewels underneath them. Don't waste moves on matches that don't contribute to your goal.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Work from the Bottom:** When possible, make matches near the bottom of the board. This causes more jewels to fall from the top, increasing the chances of creating automatic chain reactions or cascades, which can help you complete objectives without using extra moves.
