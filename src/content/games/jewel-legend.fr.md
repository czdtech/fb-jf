### Présentation

Jewel Legend propose une longue série de niveaux où tu dois aligner des gemmes pour atteindre différents objectifs (score, blocages à briser, objets à faire descendre, etc.).

### Conseils

- Travaille depuis le bas pour créer des cascades.  
    - Garde quelques bonus pour les derniers coups sur les niveaux difficiles.  
    - Regarde le plateau au global avant de jouer pour trouver les meilleurs alignements.



    - **A:** If you fail to meet the level objective within the given number of moves, you will lose a life and have to try the level again. You can wait for lives to regenerate over time or sometimes acquire more through in-game means.

- **Q: I'm out of moves, what now?**

- **A:** The most powerful combo is swapping two Color Jewels together. This will destroy every single jewel on the screen, which is extremely useful for very difficult levels.

- **Q: What is the most powerful combination in the game?**

    - **A:** To break ice or chains, you must make a match that includes the frozen or chained jewel. Sometimes it takes more than one match to fully release a jewel.

- **Q: How do I break the ice or chains on the jewels?**

### Foire aux questions (FAQ)

- **Swap Jewels:** Click and drag a jewel to an adjacent spot to swap it with the jewel there. You can also click the first jewel and then click the adjacent one you want to swap with. The swap will only be successful if it creates a match.

The game is controlled with simple touch or mouse gestures.

### Commandes

- **Anticipate Cascades:** Making matches at the bottom of the board is often a good strategy. This allows a large number of new gems to fall into place, increasing the chance of setting off a chain reaction (cascade) of automatic matches, which can clear a large portion of the board without using any extra moves.

    - **Plan Your Moves:** You only have a limited number of moves for each level. Before making a swap, look at the entire board and the level objective. Prioritize matches that will help you achieve the goal, such as breaking frozen tiles or dropping special items.

- **Combine Boosters for Maximum Impact:** Don't just use your special gems; combine them! Swapping two special gems next to each other results in a massive board-clearing effect. For example, swapping a Bomb with a Lightning Jewel clears three rows/columns, and swapping two Color Jewels clears every single gem on the board.

    - **Match 5 Gems (in a line):** Creates a powerful Color Jewel that can clear all gems of a single color from the board.
