### Overview
Lemonade Stand models a simple storefront. Each day you purchase inventory (cups, lemons, sugar, ice), set recipe and price, and optionally advertise. Weather and random events affect demand; profit depends on matching price and stock to conditions while minimizing waste (melted ice, leftover lemons).

### How to Play
- Check forecast; raise price on hot days and buy more ice.
- Adjust recipe (more sugar/lemons) to balance cost and demand.
- Track profit/loss and iterate daily.

### Controls
- Mouse/UI to set quantities and prices; advance day.

### Tips
- Don’t overstock perishable items if the forecast is cool or rainy.
- Keep a margin for events but avoid tying up cash in excess inventory.
- Small price tests reveal elasticity for your market.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I avoid running out of stock during peak hours?  
  A: Buy a buffer of cups and ice on hot forecasts and increase price slightly.
- Q: Does advertising matter in this game?  
  A: It can boost demand, but overspending wastes money if supply is low.
- Q: What is the most important metric to watch?  
  A: Daily profit and leftover inventory; aim for steady upward trends.
