<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Fast 1v1/2v2 football with exaggerated physics and special kicks. Modes include quick match and tournament brackets.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Position for headers and volleys; time power shots when the meter is full.
- Use walls/bounces to set up angles; protect your goal after a kickoff.
- In 2‑player, coordinate roles: one presses, one covers.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Arrows/`WASD` to move/jump; shot/pass keys and special vary by host.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Jump‑timed headers are the safest way to score.
- Save specials for open looks rather than congested scrums.
- On defense, backpedal and block angles instead of lunging.
