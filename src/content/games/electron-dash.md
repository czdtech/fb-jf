### Overview
Fast tunnel runner: sprint along cylinders and platforms, leap gaps, and dash across floating tiles while the pace steadily increases.

### How to Play
- Read tile patterns ahead; jump between lanes and dash across short voids.
- Blue tiles may collapse; moving rings require precise timing.
- Push for distance and gems where present.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; Space/X to dash (host dependent).

### Tips
- Center your lane before blind rises; camera shifts can mislead footing.
- Chain dash→jump to cross long gaps; don’t spam dash on unstable tiles.
- Treat curves like lanes—switch early, not on the lip.

### FAQ
- Q: Random or fixed levels?  
  A: Many hosts use procedural sections, so runs differ.
- Q: What counts as failure?  
  A: Falling, hitting lasers, or being pushed off by rings.
- Q: Any upgrades?  
  A: Some hosts add gem unlocks or cosmetics; core loop is distance.
