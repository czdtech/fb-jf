### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Snakes and Ladders is a timeless classic board game, also known as Chutes and Ladders in some regions. Originating from ancient India, it's a game of pure luck where players race to be the first to reach the final square on the board. The journey is unpredictable, with ladders helping you climb closer to victory and snakes sliding you back down.

Conversely, if you land on a square with a snake's head, you must slide down to the square at the snake's tail.
