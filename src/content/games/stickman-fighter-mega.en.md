### Detailed Game Introduction

Stickman Fighter Mega is a side‑view beat ’em up focused on counter‑timing and spacing. Enemies telegraph swings; punish them with parries, juggles, and area specials. Later waves mix shielded foes, ranged throwers, and heavies that demand varied answers.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Parry window: Learn the parry frame and fish counter‑hits for bonus damage.
2.  Spacing: Fight just outside enemy reach; step in only on swings.
3.  Target priority: Delete ranged/fast daggers first; kite heavies.
4.  Special economy: Save AOEs for multi‑spawn waves.
5.  Combo routes: Light→Heavy→Launcher→Air juggles are high value.

### Controls Guide

- Move: Arrows/A/D; Attack: J/K; Special: L; Block/Parry: I (varies). Pause/Retry via UI.
