### Detailed Game Introduction

Endless Truck is a side‑scrolling stunt runner focused on speed control and landing angles. Hills, ramps, and gaps reward smooth throttle and controlled flips; sloppy landings bleed speed or crash. Cash pickups and missions unlock upgrades (engine, suspension, boost) that raise top speed and stability.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Land flat: Touch down with wheels level to retain speed and avoid bounce.
2.  Throttle feathering: Pulse throttle over crests to prevent nose dives.
3.  Flip discipline: Only flip when altitude and arc are safe; one clean flip beats two risky ones.
4.  Boost wisely: Use nitro on flat exits, not mid‑air; stacking boosts after clean landings yields longest runs.
5.  Upgrade order: Suspension/tires for control, then engine/boost as you stabilize.

### Controls Guide

- Accelerate/Brake: W/S or Up/Down.  Tilt: A/D or Left/Right.  Boost: `Shift`/`Space` (varies).

### Advanced Tips

- Pumping: `Tap` brake before a `drop` to lower the nose, then accelerate on landing for extra traction.
- Mission routing: Pick routes that complete multiple missions in one run (e.g., flips + distance).
- Crash recovery: If angle is bad, cut throttle and gently tilt to save the landing.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:endless-truck:i-always-wipe-out-on-9c9698af -->
  Q: I always wipe out on landings — any fix?
  
  A: Reduce flips, land with wheels level, and ease throttle until suspension settles.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:endless-truck:best-upgrade-first-23f8ce2f -->
  Q: Best upgrade first?
  
  A: Suspension/tires for handling; speed after stability.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:endless-truck:when-should-i-use-boost-4e692488 -->
  Q: When should I use boost?
  
  A: On flat ground after clean landings to extend speed without losing control.
