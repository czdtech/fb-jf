*60 Second Burger Run* is an exciting and colorful speed-running platformer where your main goal is to reach a closing burger shop within a strict 60-second time limit! You control a cheerful, chubby hero who loves tasty fast food, and you must guide him through a series of challenging stages as quickly as possible. The game tests your reaction time, precision jumping, and ability to quickly memorize paths to pass as many levels as you can before the timer hits zero. 
 
### How to Play 60 Second Burger Run
 
 -  **The Objective:** You have a total of 60 seconds to complete as many stages as possible. The ultimate goal of each stage is to run to the bus stop, get on the bus, and proceed to the next level. 
 -  **Controls:** The controls are simple. Use the **Arrow Keys** or **WASD** keys to run left and right, and to jump. 
 -  **Navigating Levels:** You need to run very fast, using your reaction and attention. You must jump high, climb over ledges, fly over sharp objects, and leap over fire pits to reach the end. 
 -  **Hazards and Warnings:** The path is filled with dangers. Be aware of colored platforms that may burst under your hero. Road signs with skulls will also warn you about upcoming cliffs. 
 -  **Timer and Respawns:** The 60-second timer is for your entire run. If you hit an obstacle but still have time left, you will restart at the beginning of the *current stage*. If the 60 seconds run out, your entire game ends, and you must start over from the very first stage.

### Strategy and Tips
 
 -  **Memorization is Key:** Since the timer doesn't reset between levels, your main strategy should be to memorize the path. The game encourages learning through repetition. Don't be discouraged if you fail; each attempt helps you learn the layout for the next run. 
 -  **Speed and Momentum:** Continuous movement is crucial. Plan your jumps to flow from one action to the next without stopping. Every second you save in an early level gives you more time for later, more difficult stages. 
 -  **Pay Attention to Visual Cues:** The game warns you about dangers. Look out for skull signs indicating cliffs and be cautious on unfamiliar colored platforms, as they might collapse. The rules for new items are often explained by "little angels" in the game.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
 
 **Q: How do I win the game?**  **A:** The game is an endless "time attack." The goal isn't to reach a final ending, but to see how many levels you can successfully complete within the 60-second time limit. A higher number of completed levels means a better score. 
 
 **Q: What happens if I hit a spike or fall?**  **A:** If you hit an obstacle, you will immediately restart the current level from its beginning. However, the main 60-second timer does NOT stop or reset, so mistakes are very costly. 
 
 **Q: How many levels are there in total?**  **A:** The game is designed to see how far you can get in one minute. While there may be a finite number of designed levels, the challenge is in completing as many as possible in a single run, not in reaching a specific final level.
