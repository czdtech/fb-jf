### Présentation

Chaque puzzle te donne une forme globale à remplir avec des grappes de cases hexagonales. Les pièces ne se font pas pivoter : la difficulté vient de l’identification de la bonne zone pour chaque groupe d’hexagones.



    - **A:** No, the game is designed to be a relaxing, stress-free experience. You can take as much time as you need to solve each puzzle.

- **Q: Is there a time limit?**

    - **A:** This usually means one of the pieces you have already placed is in the wrong spot. You may need to remove one or more pieces from the board and rethink your arrangement. If the game offers a hint system, now would be a good time to use it.

- **Q: I'm stuck and a piece won't fit anywhere! What should I do?**

    - **A:** No. In this style of puzzle, the pieces have a fixed orientation. The challenge comes from figuring out how they fit together as they are.

- **Q: Can I rotate the pieces?**

### Foire aux questions (FAQ)

- **Select and Place:** Use your mouse or finger to click and drag a hexagonal piece cluster from your inventory area and drop it onto the main puzzle board.


- **Trial and Error:** Since the pieces don't have unique picture snippets like a normal jigsaw, you will often need to use trial and error. If a piece doesn't fit, simply drag it back to your inventory and try a different one.

- **Work by Section:** Don't try to place pieces all over the board at once. Focus on completing one area, like a corner or a specific object in the picture. Completing one section often makes it much easier to see where the remaining pieces go.

- **Start with Unique Outlines:** Look for distinctive parts of the puzzle outline. If there is a long, straight edge or a unique corner, find the piece in your inventory that would fit that specific shape. This helps to anchor your puzzle.
The game is played with a simple drag-and-drop mechanic.
