### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bombs Drops Physics balls mixes gravity, timing, and simple demolition. Drop balls or bombs onto contraptions, topple stacks, and trigger chain reactions to meet level goals. The fun is in finding minimal, elegant solutions that use physics in your favor.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Scout weak points: Hit supports, wedges, or tensioned pieces to collapse structures efficiently.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Time cascades: Delay second drops so the first impact sets the stage.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Use angles: Side hits create torque and bigger topples than straight drops.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Minimize drops: Fewer, smarter drops often beat spammy solutions.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Reset often: Quick retries help you iterate on timing and angles.

### Controls Guide

- Aim and drop with mouse/touch; some levels allow limited nudges.
- Reset/Undo where available for fast iteration.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My drops barely move anything—what am I missing?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: You’re striking center mass. Target edges and supports to generate torque and collapses.

- Q: Is there scoring for fewer drops?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Many levels bonus minimal solutions; aim to complete with spare bombs.

- Q: Do levels require perfect timing?
