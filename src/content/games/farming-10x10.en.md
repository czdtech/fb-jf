### Detailed Game Introduction

Farming 10x10 is a calm shape‑placement puzzle on a 10×10 grid. You receive sets of three pieces; place them to complete rows/columns and score clears. The run ends when no legal placements remain, so the art is in preserving flexibility while constructing multi‑line clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Keep the center breathable; tidy edges gradually to avoid single‑cell traps.
2.  Reserve a pocket sized for the most awkward triominoes.
3.  Place the hardest piece first when the board is crowded.
4.  Build two‑line setups so one placement scores double clears.
5.  Avoid creating 1×n “spines” that only fit sticks.

### Controls Guide

- Drag pieces to the board; release to place; some modes allow rotate.
- Undo/Reset if provided.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I keep running out of room — solutions?
  
  A: Maintain a central open area, set aside an awkward‑piece pocket, and prioritize double clear setups.

- Q: Rotate is missing?
  
  A: Many 10×10 variants do not rotate; compensate with better pocketing.

- Q: How to chase high scores?
  
  A: Chain doubles and avoid “rescue” singles that break structure.
