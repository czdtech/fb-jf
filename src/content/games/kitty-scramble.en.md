### Detailed Game Introduction

Kitty Scramble presents themed letter grids (animals, foods, places). `Swipe` contiguous letters in any direction to form target words; extra words grant coins. Boards escalate with longer words, diagonal paths, and overlapping targets that require flexible pathing and good vocabulary.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Theme scan: Pre‑list likely words from the theme before swiping.
2.  Pattern anchors: Look for repeated bigrams/trigrams (TH, ING, EST) to seed paths.
3.  Overlaps: When a word blocks another, find an alternate route using diagonals.
4.  Bonus economy: Bank extra words early to save hints for late boards.
5.  Systematic sweep: Scan rows then columns to avoid misses.
