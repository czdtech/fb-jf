### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] "Rotate" is a challenging puzzle game where players must rotate the game world to guide a ball through complex mazes and obstacles. The game utilizes the physics properties of gravity and momentum, requiring players to cleverly control rotation angles and timing to get the ball to reach the target position in each level.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Understand Gravity Mechanics**: Master how rotation changes gravity direction and affects the ball's movement trajectory.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Observe Level Layout**: Carefully study each level's design to find the optimal rotation path.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Control Rotation Rhythm**: Don't rush to rotate; observe the ball's movement before making the next rotation.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Utilize Momentum**: Learn to use the ball's movement momentum to pass through areas that are difficult to reach directly.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Think from Multiple Angles**: Observing levels from different perspectives may reveal unexpected solutions.

### How to Play

*   **Rotation Control**: Typically use mouse dragging or keyboard arrow keys to rotate the game world.
*   **Reset**: If the ball gets stuck or falls out of bounds, you can reset the current level to start over.
*   **Pause**: You can pause the game while thinking of strategies and planning the next rotation operation.
