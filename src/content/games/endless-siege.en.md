### Detailed Game Introduction

Endless Siege is a highly engaging tower defense game that challenges you to defend your kingdom against relentless waves of orcs, goblins, and other monstrous foes. The standout feature of the game is that you are presented with a brand new, procedurally generated map every single day, ensuring endless replayability. You must strategically place and upgrade a variety of defensive towers to survive as many waves as possible and compete for the daily high score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Know Your Towers:** Understanding your defenses is key.
    *   **Ballista:** A fast-firing tower, excellent for taking down single, high-health enemies.
    *   **Torch:** A flame tower that deals area-of-effect (AoE) damage, perfect for roasting groups of weaker enemies.
    *   **Cannon:** A slow but powerful AoE tower that deals massive damage to clusters of foes.
    *   **Timewarp:** A support tower that doesn't deal damage but significantly slows down all enemies that pass through its radius, making them easier targets for your other towers.

2.  **Create Kill Zones:** Don't spread your towers out too much. Try to place them in clusters, especially around bends in the path, where multiple towers can attack the same enemies simultaneously.
3.  **The Power of Slowing:** The Timewarp tower is one of the most important in the game. Placing a Timewarp tower at the beginning of a long stretch of road allows your damage-dealing towers to get many more shots in, dramatically increasing their effectiveness.
4.  **Upgrade Strategically:** It's often better to have a few fully upgraded, powerful towers than many weak, basic ones. Focus your gold on upgrading your best-placed towers to maximize their damage output.

### Controls Guide

*   **Build a Tower:** Click on an empty circular plot on the map to bring up the build menu, then select the tower you wish to build.
*   **Upgrade a Tower:** Click on an existing tower to see its stats and available upgrades. Click the upgrade button to level it up.
*   **Call the Next Wave:** When you are ready, click the "Next Wave" button to start the next onslaught of enemies.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: What is the best tower in the game?**
    *   **A:** There is no single "best" tower. A successful defense relies on a smart combination of all four types. Use Cannons and Torches for groups, Ballistas for tough single targets, and Timewarp towers to slow everything down.

*   **Q: Why can't I build a tower somewhere?**
    *   **A:** You can only build on the designated circular plots found along the enemy path.

*   **Q: Why is the map different from yesterday?**
    *   **A:** A unique feature of Endless Siege is that a new map is generated every day, offering a fresh strategic challenge for all players.
