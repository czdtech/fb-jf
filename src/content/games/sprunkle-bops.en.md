### Sprunkle Bops Gameplay

 - Start the Battle: You’ll face off against various popular characters, each bringing their own musical flair to the rap battle. The goal is simple – follow the rhythm of the beat and land the correct notes at the right time to keep your performance on point.
 - Catch the Beat: Use your keyboard or touch controls to match the beats. You can press the ARROW KEYS, W, A, S, D, or simply tap the corresponding buttons if you are playing on a mobile device. As the music plays, the arrows will appear on your screen. Your task is to hit the matching key when they align with the beat.
 - Stay on Rhythm: As the beat intensifies, stay focused! Each character’s rap skills are powerful, and only those who can master the rhythm will win. Don’t miss a note or it’ll cost you the chance to win the battle.
