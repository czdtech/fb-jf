### Detailed Game Introduction

Sum 2048 is a relaxed numeric puzzler where you connect equal tiles to merge them into higher values. Good board management, forward planning, and cascade setups produce long runs and big totals.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Centralize highs: Keep larger values toward the middle to allow multi‑direction merges.
2.  **[DE]** Avoid dead corners: Corners trap values; use edges for feeders.
3.  **[DE]** Two‑step plans: Prepare pairs so a merge unlocks another merge.
4.  **[DE]** Space first: When crowded, clear a lane before chasing big merges.
5.  **[DE]** Patience: Incremental merges keep options open longer than rush plays.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to connect equal numbers per rules.
- Undo/Reset (if available) to recover misplays.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I get stuck quickly—why? Over‑merging into corners; keep highs central and lanes open.
- Endless? Usually; aim for target sums or high scores.
- Hints? Use sparingly to maintain challenge.
