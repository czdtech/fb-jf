### Detailed Game Introduction

Billiards Classic brings the traditional game of 8-ball pool to your screen. This simulation pits you against a computer opponent in a test of skill, strategy, and physics. The objective is to be the first to pocket your assigned group of balls (either solids or stripes) and then legally sink the 8-ball to win the game. With realistic physics and intuitive controls, it’s a perfect way to enjoy a timeless pub classic.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Break:** The game starts with a break shot. Aim for the front ball of the rack to scatter the balls effectively.
2.  **Claiming Your Suit:** After the break, the table is "open." The first player to legally pocket a ball will be assigned that group for the rest of the game (either solids 1-7 or stripes 9-15).
3.  **Plan Your Shots:** Don't just aim for the easiest shot. Think two or three steps ahead. Try to sink your balls in an order that also sets up your cue ball for your next shot.
4.  **Use English (Spin):** For more advanced control, use the spin function. Applying backspin can stop your cue ball, while topspin will make it follow the object ball. Side-spin can change the angle it takes after hitting a rail.
5.  **Winning the Game:** Once you have pocketed all seven of your designated balls, you must then legally pocket the 8-ball into a called pocket to win. Pocketing the 8-ball before clearing your group, or scratching on the 8-ball shot, results in a loss.

*   **Set Power:** Click and drag the power meter (usually on the side or bottom) to determine the strength of your shot.
*   **Apply Spin (English):** Use the on-screen spin controller to adjust where on the cue ball your stick will hit, applying spin.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:billiards-classic:q-what-happens-if-i-63f35f02 -->
  **Q: What happens if I sink the 8-ball by accident at the start?**
    *   **A:** If you pocket the 8-ball on the break, you usually get to choose to re-rack or spot the 8-ball and continue playing. If you pocket it during regular play before clearing your group, you lose the game.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:billiards-classic:q-what-is-a-foul-11e47ab0 -->
  **Q: What is a foul?**
    *   **A:** A foul occurs if you pocket the cue ball ("scratch"), hit the opponent's ball first, or fail to hit any ball at all. After a foul, your opponent gets "ball-in-hand," meaning they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table for their shot.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:billiards-classic:q-which-balls-are-mine-e6a32756 -->
  **Q: Which balls are mine?**
    *   **A:** The table is open until the first ball is legally pocketed. If you sink a solid, you are solids. If you sink a stripe, you are stripes.
