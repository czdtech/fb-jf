### Detailed Game Introduction

Timber Guy is a one‑button timing game. Chop the trunk while switching sides to avoid incoming branches. The pace accelerates, demanding clean side swaps and steady rhythm.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Read ahead: Watch the next few branches and pre‑plan swaps.
2.  Keep rhythm: Maintain a steady chop tempo for better reactions.
3.  Early swaps: Switch sides slightly before the branch passes you.
4.  Don’t panic: Miss one beat if unsure; safety beats a hit.
5.  High score: Small errors compound—reset after bad starts.

### Controls Guide

- Chop/Swap: Tap left/right to chop from that side.
- Pause/Retry via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Why do I get hit? Late swaps—change sides earlier.
- Does speed ramp? Yes; rhythm helps adaptation.
- Any power‑ups? Some versions include boosters; focus on consistency.
