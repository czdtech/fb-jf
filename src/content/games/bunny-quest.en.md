### Detailed Game Introduction

Bunny Quest is a path‑building slider puzzle. Rearrange tiles to form an unbroken route from start to finish, collect optional items, and avoid dead‑ends as move limits tighten in later levels.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Corners and straights: Place corner/straight tiles to sketch the main path first.
2.  Avoid loops: Don’t waste moves forming isolated loops that don’t reach the goal.
3.  Save junctions: Use T‑junctions and crosses late to resolve branching.
4.  Minimal moves: Track move counts and reverse steps early if inefficient.
5.  Optional items: Route them only when they don’t explode move counts.

### Controls Guide

- Slide tiles by dragging; tiles shift along rows/columns per rules.
- Undo/Reset if available to optimize routes.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Stuck with one tile off? Backtrack earlier; try anchoring start and end first.
- Timers? Some stages use move limits, not strict timers.
- Hints? Many versions include hints; use sparingly.
