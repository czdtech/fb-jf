### Overview
A crossword puzzle is a word grid solved by filling Across and Down entries that match numbered clues. In American‑style crosswords, every letter is checked by an intersecting word and grids typically have rotational symmetry; daily puzzles are often 15×15 and Sunday‑size 21×21. British/cryptic styles feature different clue conventions and grid patterns. 

### How to Play
- Select a clue or cell, then type letters to fill the entry.  
- Use arrow keys to move between cells; Backspace deletes; Enter or Tab often switches direction or advances to the next clue (varies by host).  
- Cross‑checking: use intersecting letters to confirm uncertain answers.  
- Many online versions provide Check/Reveal/Undo tools and timers.  

### Controls
- Type A–Z to enter letters; arrow keys navigate.  
- Backspace: delete previous letter.  
- Enter/Tab: toggle direction or jump to next clue (site‑dependent).  
- Mouse/touch: tap a clue list item to focus its entry.  

### Tips and Strategies
- Start with fill‑in‑the‑blank clues and plural/tense indicators (-S, -ED, -ING).  
- Use cross letters to break tough entries; revisit long themers after filling nearby downs.  
- Learn common abbreviations and crosswordese (abbr., init., alt. spellings).  
- For cryptic/British styles, parse definition + wordplay components and indicator words.  

### FAQ
- Q: What’s the difference between American and British crosswords?  
  A: American grids usually have all letters cross‑checked and rotational symmetry; British cryptics use wordplay‑based clues and often allow unchecked letters.  
- Q: What size is a typical daily puzzle?  
  A: Common sizes are 15×15 daily and 21×21 on Sundays (varies by publisher).  
- Q: Are diacritics or punctuation required?  
  A: Most crosswords ignore punctuation and accents; fill letters only unless specified.
