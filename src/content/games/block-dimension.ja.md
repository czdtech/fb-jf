### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Block Dimension is a captivating puzzle game that takes the classic block-fitting formula into a new dimension. Played on a 10x10 grid, the game challenges you to strategically place blocks of various shapes to clear lines both horizontally and vertically. Unlike traditional block puzzlers, Block Dimension often introduces unique twists and a sleek, modern aesthetic. The goal is to score as many points as possible by clearing lines and creating combos before you run out of space on the board.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Think Ahead:** You are typically shown three block shapes at a time. Before placing the first one, visualize how all three could potentially fit on the board. Good planning is key to long-term survival.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Keep the Board Open:** Avoid creating single, isolated holes in your structure, as they can be very difficult to fill later. Try to keep your stacks relatively flat and open.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Aim for Combos:** The most effective way to get a high score is by clearing multiple lines (rows or columns) with a single piece. Look for opportunities to set up these chain reactions.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Don't Rush:** There is no time limit, so take your time to find the optimal placement for each piece. A single bad move can quickly lead to a game over.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Manage Large Pieces:** Be mindful of the large, awkward pieces like the 3x3 square. If you don't have a good spot for them, they can quickly clog up your board.
