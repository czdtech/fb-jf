<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Fast tunnel runner: sprint along cylinders and platforms, leap gaps, and dash across floating tiles while the pace steadily increases.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Read tile patterns ahead; jump between lanes and dash across short voids.
- Blue tiles may collapse; moving rings require precise timing.
- Push for distance and gems where present.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; Space/X to dash (host dependent).

### Tips
- Center your lane before blind rises; camera shifts can mislead footing.
- Chain dash→jump to cross long gaps; don’t spam dash on unstable tiles.
- Treat curves like lanes—switch early, not on the lip.

### FAQ
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:electron-dash:random-or-fixed-levels-bbc83643 -->
  Q: Random or fixed levels?
  A: Many hosts use procedural sections, so runs differ.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:electron-dash:what-counts-as-failure-4929d013 -->
  Q: What counts as failure?
  A: Falling, hitting lasers, or being pushed off by rings.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:electron-dash:any-upgrades-2e662d37 -->
  Q: Any upgrades?
