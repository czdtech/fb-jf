### **Game Introduction**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Happy Wheels is a physics-based, side-scrolling platformer game known for its graphic violence and dark humor. The gameplay does not focus on simply winning, but on survival. Players control a variety of unconventional characters, each with a unique and often comically unsafe vehicle, such as a dad on a bicycle with his son, a man in a jet-powered wheelchair, or a person on a Segway.
6.  **Explore Different レベル Types**: Don't just play the featured levels. Use the level browser to find different kinds of challenges. Search for terms like "puzzle," "rope swing," or "BMX" to find unique and creative maps made by the community.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The primary objective in most levels is to navigate a treacherous obstacle course and reach a finish line. The challenge lies in the game's brutal and realistic physics engine. Characters can be dismembered, crushed, and impaled in countless gruesome ways, yet can often continue towards the goal as long as their core body is intact.
The controls are relatively standard but have specific functions for each character.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] A defining feature of Happy Wheels is its extensive user-generated content. The game includes a powerful level editor, allowing players to create and share their own complex, creative, and often sadistic courses. This results in a virtually endless supply of levels, ranging from simple races to elaborate puzzle-solving adventures and impossible-to-survive death traps.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Control Your Speed**: Speed is not always your friend. Going too fast often leads to losing control and crashing into an obstacle. Learn to gently accelerate and decelerate to navigate tight spaces and unpredictable terrain.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Master Your Character**: Each character controls differently and has unique special abilities.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Wheelchair Guy**: His jet booster provides a powerful burst of speed, useful for clearing large gaps, but it's hard to control. Use it in short bursts.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Segway Guy**: Can jump, making him more agile for platforming challenges. His upright stance, however, makes him very unstable.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Irresponsible Dad**: Can brake hard. His son adds extra weight and can be detached, sometimes serving as a morbid counterweight or shield.
**1. Why is this game so graphic and violent?**（日本語訳が必要）
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Lean for Balance**: Leaning your character forward and backward (using the up and down arrow keys) is crucial for maintaining balance. Lean back when going up steep hills to prevent flipping over, and lean forward when going down to maintain speed and control.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Survival Over Perfection**: You don't need to finish a level in pristine condition. You can win a level even if your character has lost both legs and an arm. The goal is to get the character's torso to the finish line. Sometimes, sacrificing a limb to an obstacle is a viable strategy.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Learn to Eject**: The 'Z' key allows most characters to eject from their vehicle. This is a last-ditch move that can be used to fling your character's body across a gap to the finish line when the vehicle is destroyed or stuck.
