### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Look for Special Gem Combinations:** Matching more than three jewels in a row or in specific shapes (like L or T) will create powerful special gems. These can clear entire rows, columns, or explode to clear a large area.
2.  **Prioritize Level Objectives:** Always keep an eye on your current level's objective. Sometimes it's about reaching a score, other times it's about clearing specific blocks or collecting certain items. Focus your moves on achieving these goals.
3.  **Combine Special Gems:** The most effective way to clear large parts of the board and overcome difficult obstacles is by combining two special gems. For example, combining two line-clearing gems can clear a cross-section of the board.
4.  **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the game board can cause more gems to fall from above, potentially creating new matches and cascades automatically. This can be a very efficient strategy.
5.  **Plan Ahead:** Don't just make the first match you see. Look at the entire board and plan your moves to set up bigger combinations and achieve your objectives more efficiently.
