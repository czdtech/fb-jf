[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Jewel Magic is a classic and captivating match-3 puzzle game that invites you into a world of sparkling gems and enchanting challenges. The core objective is to swap adjacent jewels to create a line of three or more identical gems, causing them to vanish and score points. With hundreds of levels, each presenting a unique goal, players must think strategically to create powerful special jewels, trigger dazzling chain reactions, and solve every puzzle presented to them.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Master the Special Gems:** To pass the toughest levels, you must create and utilize special gems. These are formed by matching more than three jewels at once:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Lightning Jewel:** Match 4 jewels in a line to create a jewel that can clear an entire row or column.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Bomb Jewel:** Match 5 jewels in an L or T shape to create a bomb that explodes and destroys a block of surrounding jewels.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Rainbow Jewel:** Match 5 jewels in a straight line to create a powerful rainbow jewel. Swap it with any adjacent jewel to remove all jewels of that color from the board.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Combine for Power:** The ultimate strategy is to combine two special jewels. Swapping a bomb and a lightning jewel, for instance, creates a massive cross-shaped blast. Experiment with different combinations to see their powerful effects.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Focus on the Goal:** Each level has a specific objective, such as reaching a target score, clearing all the jelly from behind the jewels, or dropping special items to the bottom. Always focus your efforts on achieving that goal within the limited number of moves.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Start from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the grid increases the chance of causing a cascade, where new jewels fall into place and create automatic matches. This can help you clear the board and reach your goal much faster.
