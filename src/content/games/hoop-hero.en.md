### Detailed Game Introduction

Hoop Hero is a minimalist and addictive one-touch arcade game that tests your timing and reflexes. The gameplay is simple: a basketball moves, and you must tap the screen at the precise moment it aligns with the hoop to score a dunk. The challenge comes from the increasing speed and tricky patterns of the ball's movement. The goal is to score as many consecutive dunks as possible to achieve a new high score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Focus on the Timing:** This game is all about rhythm and timing. Don't get distracted. Watch the ball's movement pattern and anticipate when it will cross over the hoop.
2.  **Aim for Perfect Swishes:** While just getting the ball in is enough, many versions of this game reward "perfect" or "swish" shots (dunking without hitting the rim) with extra points. Try to tap when the ball is perfectly centered over the hoop.
3.  **Stay Calm:** As your streak gets longer, the pressure builds. The key to a high score is to stay calm and maintain your focus. One rushed or panicked tap will end your run.
4.  **Learn the Patterns:** The ball doesn't always move in a simple back-and-forth line. Pay attention to different movement patterns as they appear so you can adapt your timing accordingly.
