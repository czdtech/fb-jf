### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Puzzle Pieces Merge offers a serene and innovative twist on the classic jigsaw puzzle. Instead of a static board, this game invites you to drag, drop, and merge puzzle pieces to reveal beautiful, captivating landscapes. The core mechanic involves correctly placing pieces next to each other, at which point they will merge into a larger segment of the final image. With the ability to rotate pieces and use strategic power-ups, it’s a relaxing yet engaging experience for puzzle lovers.
