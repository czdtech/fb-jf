### Detailed Game Introduction

Smarty Bubbles is a polished and highly addictive bubble shooter game that offers a pure, classic experience. The objective is to clear the entire board of colorful bubbles by shooting and matching them. Aim your cannon, fire a bubble, and if you connect three or more of the same color, they will pop! The game challenges you to clear the board efficiently, as missed shots will cause the ceiling to drop, adding a layer of pressure to this relaxing puzzle.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Avoid Misses:** This is the most critical rule in Smarty Bubbles. After a certain number of shots that don't result in a pop (a "miss"), a new row of bubbles will be added from the top. Keep an eye on the indicator (usually a row of grey bubbles) that shows how many misses you have left before a new row appears.
2.  **[ES]** **Aim for Clusters:** The most efficient way to clear the board is to aim for matches that are holding up other bubbles. Popping a high cluster can cause a large number of bubbles below it to fall, clearing the screen much faster and earning you more points.
3.  **[ES]** **Use the Walls:** Master the art of the bank shot. Bouncing bubbles off the side walls is essential for reaching difficult spots and setting up strategic matches that aren't possible with a direct shot.
4.  **[ES]** **Plan Ahead:** The game shows you which color bubble is coming up next. Use this information to plan your next one or two moves for maximum efficiency.

### Controls Guide

*   **[ES]** **Aim:** Move your mouse to aim the cannon. A guideline will show the bubble's trajectory.
*   **[ES]** **Shoot:** Click the left mouse button to fire the bubble.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[ES]** **Q: Why did a new row of bubbles suddenly appear at the top?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** You made too many non-popping shots (misses). After a set number of misses, the game adds a new row to increase the challenge. Try to make every shot count!

*   **[ES]** **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** To clear all the bubbles from the board. The game is endless, so the ultimate goal is to achieve the highest possible score by surviving as long as you can.

*   **[ES]** **Q: How do I get a high score?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** High scores are achieved by creating large chain reactions. Dropping big clusters of bubbles by popping the ones holding them up will award you a large number of bonus points.
