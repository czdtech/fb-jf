### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Kitchen Sorting is a fast, visual logic game about placing items into correct bins: produce vs meats, recyclables vs trash, clean tools vs dirty ones, hot vs cold storage, etc. Levels add misleaders (e.g., cooked vs raw), combo objectives (sort three safe items in a row), and penalties for wrong placement or delays. Difficulty rises with simultaneous conveyors and stricter hygiene rules that punish cross‑contamination.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Big rules first: Prioritize health‑critical splits (raw meats vs ready‑to‑eat) before fine categories.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Visual cues: Learn iconography (recycle marks, thermometer symbols) to speed decisions.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Buffering: If allowed, park unclear items briefly to avoid mistakes under rush.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Combo routing: Chain easy items to maintain streak multipliers; insert tricky items during lulls.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Error control: One mistake costs more than a slight delay — skip uncertain picks.

### Controls Guide

- Drag or tap items into labeled bins; pause/retry via UI; hints may highlight correct zones.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
