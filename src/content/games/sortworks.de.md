### Detailed Game Introduction

SortWorks blends visual sorting with bin constraints (color/shape/type). Items arrive on belts; you must route them to correct bins, using buffer slots to prevent jams. Late boards raise speed and add tricky categories.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Rule hierarchy: Apply critical rules first (e.g., hazard vs non‑hazard) then fine categories.
2.  **[DE]** Buffer discipline: Keep at least one buffer slot free at all times.
3.  **[DE]** Batch easy items: Chain streaks on simple categories to maintain multipliers.
4.  **[DE]** Error cost: Skip uncertain items rather than mis‑sort.
5.  **[DE]** Eye flow: Scan ahead of the belt; don’t tunnel on the nearest item.

### Controls Guide

- Drag/tap items to bins; pause/retry via UI; hints may highlight targets.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I jam belts.

A: You’re consuming buffers; clear an easy batch to reopen space before tackling hard items.

- Q: Similar icons confuse me.

A: Learn 2–3 anchor features per category (shape/edge/color) and sort by those first.

- Q: Do streaks matter?

A: Yes — streaks boost scores; feed them with easy items.
