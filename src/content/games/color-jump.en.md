### Detailed Game Introduction

Color Jump is a minimalist reflex game where your character can pass only through matching‑color gates or platforms. Time jumps to align colors, avoid mismatched barriers, and maintain rhythm as speed increases.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Read two obstacles ahead; don’t fixate on the nearest gate.
2.  Keep a steady tap cadence; late jumps often dodge low obstacles better.
3.  Skip risky coins when alignment is off.
4.  Practice color order patterns if they loop.
5.  Use sound cues to stabilize timing on dense sets.
