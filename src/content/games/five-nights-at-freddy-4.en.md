<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Home‑set horror focused on audio cues: you patrol bedroom doors, closet, and bed, using the flashlight and careful listening to avoid jumpscares.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Approach a door and pause to listen; shut doors if you hear breathing.
- Flash the hallway only when safe; check the closet and bed regularly.
- Later nights increase speed and require tighter timing.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Mouse/keyboard to move between locations; specific keys for doors and flashlight vary by host.

### Tips
- Always listen before flashing the light at a doorway.
- Build a loop (left door → right door → closet → bed) and repeat quickly.
- Headphones help distinguish subtle breathing and footsteps.
