### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Gunspin turns recoil into movement: each shot spins and propels your weapon/body forward. Stages scatter ammo, coins, and hazards. Managing angle and shot timing yields long glides and chain pickups; upgrades add firepower and control.

### How to Play
- Fire at shallow angles to maintain forward velocity.
- Save bursts for upward corrections or hazard avoidance.
- Spend coins on guns that match your style (spread vs. precise).

### Controls
- Mouse/Space to shoot; timing and aim set trajectory.

### Tips
- Small taps > full bursts for efficiency.
- Aim slightly behind your path to push forward without stalling.
- Use bounce surfaces to refresh trajectory.
