### Detailed Game Introduction

Football Penalty focuses on spot‑kicks. As the taker, you must select placement, height, and power while disguising intent. As the keeper (in some modes), you read the run‑up and dive accordingly. Clean corners, low drives, and late disguise beat average AI.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Corners: Aim low corners for harder saves; high corners are strong but risk the bar.
2.  Disguise: Vary run‑up angles and shoot late to avoid telegraphing.
3.  Power: Medium‑high power keeps shots quick without ballooning.
4.  Keeper mode: Move late and dive toward foot/open‑body side.
5.  Mind wind (if modeled): Offset slightly and reduce height.
