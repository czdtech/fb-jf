### Game Introduction

Tap-Tap Shots is a simple, minimalist, and highly addictive arcade basketball game. The goal is to score as many points as possible by tapping the screen to make the ball bounce into the hoop. The challenge comes from the moving hoop and the pressure of the shot clock, requiring perfect timing and a steady rhythm to succeed.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Objective:** Score as many baskets in a row as you can.
- **Tapping:** Each tap makes the ball jump. You can tap multiple times in the air to gain more height.
- **Timing:** The key to scoring is to tap at the right moment to guide the ball into the hoop.
- **Combos:** Scoring consecutive baskets will set the ball on fire, which activates a score multiplier for bonus points. Clean shots that don't touch the rim also award extra points.
- **Timer:** After each successful shot, the timer resets, but if you miss, the game is over.

### Controls Guide

The controls are extremely simple:
- **PC:** `Left Mouse Button` or `Spacebar` to tap.
- **Mobile:** Tap the screen.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How do I get a high score?**

Focus on finding a consistent rhythm. Don't rush your shots. Aim for "clean" shots (not touching the rim) to get bonus points and try to build up a combo to set the ball on fire for a score multiplier.

**What happens when the ball is on fire?**

When the ball is on fire, you are in a combo streak. Every basket you score while the ball is on fire will be worth more points.

**Is there a trick to aiming?**

It's all about timing. Try to tap just as the ball reaches the peak of its bounce or starts to descend. This often gives you the most control for aiming at the hoop.
