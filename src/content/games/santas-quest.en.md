2.  Avoid softlocks: Don’t block narrow corridors with one‑way moves.
3.  Order of operations: Grab items in an order that minimizes backtracking.
4.  Watch timers (if any): Prioritize mandatory goals over optional stars when time is tight.
5.  Retry quickly: Short stages reward fast restarts when mistakes happen.
