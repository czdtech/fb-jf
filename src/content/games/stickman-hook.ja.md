### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] "Stickman Hook" is a physics-based swinging game where players control a stickman character, using grappling hooks to swing through levels, avoiding obstacles and performing acrobatic moves to reach the finish line. The game is widely popular for its smooth swinging mechanics and addictive physics gameplay.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Timing Mastery**: Learn to release and grab hooks at the right moments to maintain optimal swinging rhythm.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Momentum Utilization**: Use swinging momentum to gain greater speed and jumping distance.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Chain Swinging**: Use multiple hook points consecutively to maintain speed and height.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Obstacle Prediction**: Observe obstacles ahead and plan safe swinging routes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Acrobatic Performance**: Try performing flips and spins for added fun.

### How to Play

*   **Grapple**: Click or hold to fire the hook and grab onto anchor points.
*   **Release**: Release the button to let go of the hook and use inertia to continue forward.
*   **Swing**: Use physics swinging mechanics to gain momentum and direction.
