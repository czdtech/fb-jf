## English Guide

### Detailed Game Introduction

Golf and Friends is a casual mini‑golf experience with playful obstacles, ramps, and bank walls. Mastery revolves around pace control and angle selection — soft touches near cups prevent lip‑outs, and 45° bank lines make tight corners consistent. Multiplayer turns the course into a light party game.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Pace near cup: Under‑hit slightly at the rim to avoid lip‑outs.
2.  **[KO]** Bank geometry: Use 45° lines off walls to redirect into narrow lanes.
3.  **[KO]** Hazard timing: Windmills/gates need a full cycle watch.
4.  **[KO]** Two‑putt planning: Don’t force hero shots; set up a gimme second.
5.  **[KO]** Camera work: Pan/zoom to preview hidden slopes.

### Controls Guide

- Aim with mouse; pull to set power; release to putt. Reset/forfeit if stuck.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Why do my putts rim out?

A: Too much pace or a poor entry angle; slow down near the cup.

- Q: Best bank‑shot tip?

A: Aim slightly inside 45° to account for speed loss.

- Q: Multiplayer local?

A: Often hot‑seat style; pass the device between turns.
