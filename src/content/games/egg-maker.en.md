### Detailed Game Introduction

Egg Maker distills time‑management cooking into rapid stations: crack, whisk, season, heat, plate, and serve. Each order specifies a style (scrambled, sunny‑side, omelet) and doneness windows. Items on heat continue cooking, so sequencing and pickup timing decide whether you hit “perfect” or burn.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Station rhythm: Always start with the longest step (heat), then backfill short prep while the pan runs.
2.  Two‑pan flow: Stagger pans by a few seconds so you can flip/plate one while prepping the next.
3.  Doneness windows: Grab at the edge of “perfect” for score bonuses; learn visual/audio tells.
4.  Multi‑orders: Group similar styles to reuse pan state and reduce clean cycles.
5.  Upgrades: Prioritize extra pan and faster prep over décor.

### Controls Guide

- `Tap` to crack/whisk/season; `drag` to pan/plate; `tap` customer to serve.
- Pause/Retry in the UI between shifts.

### Advanced Tips

- Buffer trays: Stage plates near the pass so you spend less movement when orders spike.
- Early cancel: If an item overcooks, toss quickly to keep flow rather than serve a penalty.
- Combo routing: Serve 2–3 dishes back‑to‑back for a tip multiplier.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:egg-maker:i-keep-burning-items-how-483b18e0 -->
  Q: I keep burning items — how to fix?
  
  A: Stagger pans by 3–4 seconds, do short prep during the gap, and focus on auditory sizzle cues.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:egg-maker:which-upgrade-first-be077b24 -->
  Q: Which upgrade first?
  
  A: Extra pan > faster prep > queue size. Décor is endgame.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:egg-maker:any-trick-for-omelets-with-7e3bef76 -->
  Q: Any trick for omelets with fillings?
  
  A: Pre‑chop fillings during lulls, add early, and fold on the first “set” frame to avoid leaks.
