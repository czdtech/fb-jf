### Overview
Relaxed collect‑’em‑up on the water: rescue ducklings scattered around a pond and escort them safely back to your nest while avoiding boats and hazards.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Swim near ducklings to have them follow; return to the nest to bank them.
- Larger trains are riskier—boats can scatter your line; take safe routes.
- Upgrade your nest between trips when offered.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Mouse`/Touch or Arrows to steer.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Don’t over‑extend; bank small batches when traffic is heavy.
- Cut diagonals behind slow boats; never cross a bow head‑on.
- Keep your chain compact to avoid stragglers getting clipped.
