### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Cat Mario, more formally known as Syobon Action (しょぼんのアクション), is a Japanese freeware game that is a parody of the classic *Super Mario Bros*. At first glance, it appears to be a simple, crudely drawn clone of Mario, featuring a white cat-like character in a familiar-looking world. However, the game is infamous for being an "unfair platformer" or "troll game."

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The entire game is designed to subvert player expectations and troll them in every way imaginable. The levels are filled with countless hidden traps, invisible blocks, ground that suddenly collapses, enemies that behave unpredictably, and background elements that are actually lethal. The core gameplay is based on trial and error, requiring players to die repeatedly to memorize the location and nature of each trap. The game's humor comes from the sheer absurdity and unfairness of the deaths, and the life counter, which often goes into negative numbers, serves as a running gag. The goal is simply to reach the flagpole at the end of each stage without rage-quitting.

The controls are very simple and mimic classic 2D platformers.（日本語訳が必要）

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Why do I keep dying for no reason? This game is impossible!**
