### Detailed Game Introduction

Tile Journey is a modern and relaxing tile-matching puzzle game that challenges your strategic thinking. The goal is to clear a board stacked with various tiles by selecting three identical tiles. Unlike traditional match-3 games, you don't swap tiles. Instead, you select tiles and move them to a limited-capacity collection tray at the bottom of the screen. When three identical tiles are in the tray, they are cleared. You must plan your moves carefully to clear the entire board without letting the tray fill up.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Golden Rule:** The collection tray is limited (usually to seven slots). If you fill it completely without making a match, you lose. Every move must be made with this in mind.
2.  **Plan Ahead:** Don't just click on the first three matching tiles you see. Look at the tiles underneath. Prioritize clicking tiles that will uncover the most new tiles, giving you more options for future moves.
3.  **Use the Tray as a Holding Area:** You don't have to complete a set of three immediately. You can use the tray to temporarily hold tiles while you work to uncover the third one you need. For example, if you have two identical tiles in the tray, you can pick up other tiles while you search for the third matching one.
4.  **Look Before You Leap:** Before placing a tile in the tray, make sure you have a plan for it. If you put a tile in the tray that you can't match soon, it will just take up valuable space.
