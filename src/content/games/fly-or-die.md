### Overview
Multiplayer survival with evolution: start as a small creature, consume specific items to level up into new forms, and avoid predators and environmental threats.

### How to Play
- Check your current diet icons; only those items grant XP.
- Watch predator icons—higher tiers can kill you; hide or flee.
- Manage water/oxygen (when applicable) and use thermals/updrafts.

### Controls
- Mouse/Keyboard to move/fly; boost keys vary by host.

### Tips
- Eat safely at the edge of busy zones; don’t contest predators.
- Memorize the food chain so you can route upgrades quickly.
- Use verticality to escape—climb high or dive underground depending on form.
