### Detailed Game Introduction

Extend a stretchy arm to steal objects while dodging lasers, guards, and buzzsaws. Levels reward path planning: route around triggers, exploit timing windows, and retract fast when hazards reset.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Probe path: Move slowly to test trigger ranges.
2.  Time windows: Pass lasers/guards right after cycle flips.
3.  Angle tricks: Wrap around corners to stay outside detection cones.
4.  Risk control: Abandon greedy arcs when cycles desync.
5.  Multi‑grab: Chain safe pickups before retracting.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to stretch arm; release to retract; restart via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I trip alarms.
  
  A: Slow down near sensors and route around corners to cut line‑of‑sight.

- Q: Timing feels tight.
  
  A: Wait one full cycle; most rooms have relaxed windows.
