### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Wordler follows the modern five‑letter deduction format: each guess yields color feedback (correct letter/place, correct letter/wrong place, absent). Optimal play prunes the search space with informed guesses instead of random stabs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Strong opener: Use a high‑coverage starter with common vowels/consonants (e.g., SLATE/CRANE/ROAST).
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Letter accounting: Track confirmed/excluded letters explicitly; avoid re‑testing dead letters.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Position logic: Fix green letters, permute yellows across remaining slots.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Frequency bias: Favor common digrams (TH, CH, SH, ST) and endings (‑ER, ‑ED, ‑ING).
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Endgame pruning: Before final guesses, shortlist all valid permutations to avoid whiffs.

### Controls Guide

- Type and submit guesses; review color feedback; limited attempts per puzzle.
