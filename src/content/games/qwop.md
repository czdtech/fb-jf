### Game Introduction

"QWOP Game" is a notoriously difficult physics-based running game. Players need to use four keyboard keys (Q, W, O, P) to control a runner's leg muscles with the goal of running 100 meters without falling. The game's control scheme is extremely difficult and counterintuitive, making even the simplest forward movement challenging, which has made it a popular internet topic and challenge.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Understand Key Functions**: Q and W control the left leg's thigh and calf, while O and P control the right leg's thigh and calf.
2.  **Start with Small Steps**: Don't try to run immediately; first learn how to maintain balance and take small steps.
3.  **Maintain Rhythm**: Find a steady key-pressing rhythm, usually alternating presses to simulate walking motion.
4.  **Avoid Excessive Force**: Pressing keys too quickly or forcefully will cause the character to lose balance and fall.
5.  **Practice Patiently**: This game requires extensive practice to master; don't give up due to frequent failures.

### How to Play

*   **Q Key**: Controls left leg thigh muscle
*   **W Key**: Controls left leg calf muscle
*   **O Key**: Controls right leg thigh muscle
*   **P Key**: Controls right leg calf muscle

### Frequently Asked Questions

1.  **Q: Why does the character always fall backwards?**
    **A**: This is likely because you're pressing keys too aggressively or not maintaining proper balance. Try a gentler, more rhythmic key-pressing approach.
2.  **Q: Are there any successful key combinations?**
    **A**: There's no fixed formula for success, but many players find that alternating, rhythmic key presses are more effective than random pressing.
3.  **Q: What's the furthest distance possible?**
    **A**: The game's goal is to run 100 meters, but most players struggle to get past 10 meters. Running over 50 meters is considered quite impressive.
4.  **Q: Is this game intentionally designed to be this difficult?**
    **A**: Yes, QWOP was designed to demonstrate the complexity of human movement and how seemingly simple running actually requires incredibly precise coordination.
