### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pick a Lock is a minimalist rhythm‑timing game: a dial sweeps around a lock, and you must tap exactly when it passes highlighted markers. Later locks add multiple markers, tighter windows, and reversed sweeps, rewarding calm focus.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Count rhythm: Lock into the dial’s beat; tap on the beat rather than by eye alone.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Peripheral vision: Watch the next marker while tapping the current.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Noise control: Mute distractions and keep a steady posture for precision.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Recovery: If you miss, reset your cadence before the next marker.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Late‑tap bias: Slightly late taps are safer than early in many builds.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/click when the dial overlaps markers; some variants support key presses.
