<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
A crossword puzzle is a word grid solved by filling Across and Down entries that match numbered clues. In American‑style crosswords, every letter is checked by an intersecting word and grids typically have rotational symmetry; daily puzzles are often 15×15 and Sunday‑size 21×21. British/cryptic styles feature different clue conventions and grid patterns.

### How to Play
- Select a clue or cell, then type letters to fill the entry.  
- Use arrow keys to move between cells; Backspace deletes; Enter or Tab often switches direction or advances to the next clue (varies by host).  
- Cross‑checking: use intersecting letters to confirm uncertain answers.  
- Many online versions provide Check/Reveal/Undo tools and timers.  

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Type A–Z to enter letters; arrow keys navigate.  
- Backspace: delete previous letter.  
- Enter/Tab: toggle direction or jump to next clue (site‑dependent).  
- Mouse/touch: tap a clue list item to focus its entry.  

### Tips and Strategies
- Start with fill‑in‑the‑blank clues and plural/tense indicators (-S, -ED, -ING).  
- Use cross letters to break tough entries; revisit long themers after filling nearby downs.  
- Learn common abbreviations and crosswordese (abbr., init., alt. spellings).  
- For cryptic/British styles, parse definition + wordplay components and indicator words.
