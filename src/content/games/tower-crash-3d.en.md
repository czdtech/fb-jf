### Detailed Game Introduction

Tower Crash 3D is a satisfying and addictive physics-based puzzle game where your goal is to demolish towers made of colorful blocks. The catch is that you must shoot balls of a specific color, and they will only destroy blocks of the same color. With limited ammunition for each level, you must aim strategically to hit critical support blocks and cause the entire structure to come crashing down below the goal line.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Match the Colors:** This is the most important rule. Look at the color of the ball loaded in your cannon and aim only for blocks of that same color. Hitting a different colored block will do nothing and waste a precious shot.
2.  **Aim for the Base:** Like in any demolition game, the foundation is key. Prioritize shooting the lowest blocks of the correct color. Removing the base supports will destabilize the tower and cause a much larger collapse than shooting at the top.
3.  **Look for Chain Reactions:** Sometimes, a single block might be supporting several others. Identify these critical blocks and target them to get the most destruction out of a single shot.
4.  **Conserve Your Shots:** You have a limited number of balls for each level. Don't fire randomly. Take a moment to aim each shot for maximum impact.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:tower-crash-3d:q-why-didnt-the-block-77a5406a -->
  **Q: Why didn't the block break when I shot it?**
    *   **A:** You must hit a block with a ball of the exact same color. If your ball is blue, it will only destroy blue blocks.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:tower-crash-3d:q-how-do-i-complete-32e2955f -->
  **Q: How do I complete a level?**
    *   **A:** You win the level when the highest point of the remaining structure falls below the goal line indicated on the screen. You must do this before running out of cannonballs.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:tower-crash-3d:q-what-is-the-best-53b988a8 -->
  **Q: What is the best strategy if the tower is multi-colored?**
    *   **A:** Wait for your cannon to load the color you need. The color of the ball in your cannon changes, so be patient and wait for the right color to target the tower's weakest point.
