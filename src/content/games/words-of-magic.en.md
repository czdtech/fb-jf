### Detailed Game Introduction

Words of Magic is a relaxing and enchanting word puzzle game designed to test your vocabulary and anagram skills. In each level, you are given a circle of letters and a crossword-style puzzle board. Your goal is to find all of the hidden words that can be formed from the given letters and completely fill out the crossword grid. It's a perfect game to unwind with while giving your brain a gentle workout.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Start with the Obvious:** Look for the shortest and most obvious words first (usually three-letter words). Filling these in can give you clues and letters for the longer, more complex words.
2.  **Shuffle the Letters:** If you get stuck and can't see any more words, use the "Shuffle" button. Rearranging the letters in the circle can often spark new ideas and help you see combinations you missed before.
3.  **Use Hints Sparingly:** The "Hint" button will reveal a random letter in the puzzle for you, which can be a great help. However, you usually have a limited number of hints, so save them for when you are truly stuck.
4.  **Find Bonus Words:** Don't stop once the crossword is full! Most levels have extra "Bonus Words." These are valid words made from the letters that don't fit into the main puzzle. Finding them will award you extra coins or points.
