### Detailed Game Introduction

Panenka Football focuses on the cheeky Panenka — a soft chip down the middle as the keeper dives. Mix chips with corners and height variations; success relies on late aim changes and reading keeper habits.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Keeper read: If the keeper dives early, chip middle; if he holds, pick corners.
2.  **[KO]** Height control: Low hard drives vs cautious keepers; soft chips vs aggressive ones.
3.  **[KO]** Disguise: Delay final aim to avoid telegraphing; vary run‑up angles.
4.  **[KO]** Rhythm: Don’t overuse Panenkas; rotate options.
5.  **[KO]** Wind (if any): Offset shots slightly; keep chips low in strong wind.

### Controls Guide

- Aim with mouse/keys; set power/height; optional swerve via drag if supported.
