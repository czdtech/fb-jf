### Detailed Game Introduction

Parking Jam is a Rush‑Hour style puzzle: slide cars along their lanes to clear the path for the target vehicle. Higher levels cram lots with multi‑length cars, one‑way arrows, and blockers requiring precise order of operations.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** Goal backchain: Work backward from the exit to identify cars that truly gate progress.
2.  **[ES]** Minimal moves: Prefer moves that unlock multiple vehicles rather than local shuffles.
3.  **[ES]** Buffer lanes: Open a buffer lane early to allow deeper rearrangements.
4.  **[ES]** Priority stack: Park non‑critical cars in dead zones to keep corridors free.
5.  **[ES]** Undo early: If progress stalls, rewind before the last “dead shuffle” and choose a different unlock.

### Controls Guide

- Drag cars along permitted axes; undo/reset via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I spin wheels with no progress — advice?

A: Reassess which car blocks the exit chain; find a move that frees multiple cars.

- Q: Are diagonal moves allowed?

A: No — cars slide only along their length.

- Q: Any hints?

A: Many versions include step‑wise hints; use sparingly to preserve challenge.
