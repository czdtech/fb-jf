### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bloons TD 6 is the latest and most expansive installment in the acclaimed tower defense series. The game elevates the classic formula with full 3D graphics, a host of new mechanics, and an unprecedented level of strategic depth. The objective remains to strategically place and upgrade monkey towers to prevent waves of "Bloons" from reaching the exit.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game fundamentally changes the upgrade system by giving each tower **three distinct upgrade paths**. A single tower can be upgraded to Tier 5 on one path, and up to Tier 2 on another path (e.g., a 5/2/0 or 5/0/2 build), but the third path remains locked. This system creates an immense variety of specialized roles for every tower.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Major New Features of Bloons TD 6:**
-   **Heroes:** Players choose a powerful Hero to place on the field. Heroes level up automatically throughout the game, unlocking devastating new abilities without costing any in-game money. Each Hero has a unique playstyle.
    - **Sauda:** Excellent for maps with single choke points or sharp corners, dominating the early game.（日本語訳が必要）

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. What is the best Hero to start with?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > **Sauda** is widely considered the most beginner-friendly Hero. She is relatively cheap and can single-handedly beat the first 20-30 rounds on most beginner maps, allowing you to focus on building your economy.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. How do I beat DDTs? They are destroying my defense.**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > DDTs require a multi-faceted defense. You need towers that can see camo, pop lead/black, and have high damage. A Monkey Village with **Monkey Intelligence Bureau (x/3/x)** is invaluable, as it lets all nearby towers damage any Bloon type. Pair this with high-damage towers like a 2/0/5 Tack Shooter or a 0/2/5 Perma-Spike factory.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. Why can't I damage the Purple Bloons?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > Purple Bloons are immune to energy, plasma, fire, and magic-based attacks. This includes many upgrades from the Wizard Monkey and Super Monkey. You must use towers that fire physical projectiles, like a Crossbow Master (Dart Monkey 0/2/5) or a Juggernaut (Dart Monkey 5/x/x).

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. How do I make a Paragon?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > To create a Paragon, you must first have all three Tier 5 towers of a single monkey type (e.g., all three Tier 5 Dart Monkeys) placed on the map. Once you do, the upgrade button on any of them will change to a Paragon upgrade. The power of the Paragon depends on factors like the number of towers sacrificed, their total pop count, and money invested.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **5. What is CHIMPS mode?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > CHIMPS is the hardest game mode in BTD6. It's an acronym for the rules: **N**o **C**ontinues, **N**o **H**earts Lost, **N**o **I**ncome (other than popping Bloons), **N**o **M**onkey Knowledge, **N**o **P**owers, and **N**o **S**elling. It is the ultimate test of a player's strategy.
