<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
`Swipe` to slice fruit mid‑air. Avoid bombs and aim for combos and criticals. Modes vary by host (classic, arcade, zen).

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Draw swift, clean lines through multiple fruit for combo points.
- Let bombs pass; hitting one ends runs or deducts heavily.
- Time frenzy bananas (when present) for massive chains.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Mouse`/Touch swipes to slice; pause/retry via UI.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Aim to intersect as many fruit trajectories as possible per stroke.
- Use diagonal swipes; they cross more spawn arcs.
- In Zen‑style modes, optimize pathing since bombs are absent.
