### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Age of War is a classic 2D side-scrolling strategy game that became widely popular during the Flash game era. The game's core concept is a battle between two bases, one belonging to the player and the other to an AI opponent. The unique and defining feature of the game is its "evolution" mechanic. Players start in the Stone Age (as cavemen) and must earn experience points (XP) to advance through five distinct eras: Stone Age, Middle Ages, Modern Age, and finally, the Future Age. Each evolution not only unlocks more powerful units and defensive turrets but also fully restores your base's health. The ultimate goal is simple: survive the enemy's onslaught and destroy their base.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mastering Age of War requires a balance of offense, defense, and strategic timing.

#### 1. Early Game Strategy (Stone Age)
*   **The Caveman Rush:** The most common and effective opening strategy is to spam the cheapest unit, the "Club Man." They are cost-effective and can quickly overwhelm the enemy in the early stages.
*   **Focus on XP:** Your primary goal is to kill enemy units to gain XP as quickly as possible. A strong offensive push helps you earn XP faster, leading to an earlier evolution.
*   **First Turret:** Build the first turret (Sling Shot) as soon as you can afford it. It provides crucial defensive support and helps you conserve units and health while you save up for more powerful troops or your first evolution.

#### 2. Mid-Game Strategy (Middle Ages & Modern Age)
*   **Balanced Army:** Stop spamming only one type of unit. Create a balanced force. Place melee units (knights, infantry) at the front to absorb damage and protect your powerful but fragile ranged units (archers, riflemen) in the back.
*   **When to Evolve:** Timing your evolution is critical. The best time to evolve is when your base health is low, as evolving fully restores it. Alternatively, evolve when you have a clear battlefield advantage to press your attack with superior units. Don't evolve if you are in the middle of a strong push, as it will clear all your units from the field.
*   **Use Your Special Ability:** Each age comes with a powerful special ability (e.g., meteor shower, god's wrath). These have a long cooldown but can turn the tide of a battle. Use them to wipe out a large wave of enemy units or to support your own major offensive.

#### 3. Late Game Strategy (Future Age)
*   **The Super Soldier:** In the Future Age, the "Super Soldier" is one of the most powerful units in the game. They are expensive but incredibly durable and have immense firepower. Saving up for a few of these can create an unstoppable force.
*   **Advanced Turrets:** Fully upgrade your turrets. The final-era turrets deal massive damage and are essential for defending against the enemy's powerful futuristic units.
*   **Final Push:** Coordinate your most powerful units with your special ability for a final, decisive push to destroy the enemy base.

### Controls Guide

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is controlled almost entirely with the mouse.

*   **Train Units:** Click on the unit icons at the top-left of the screen to train them. You must have enough gold.
*   **Build Turrets:** Click on the empty turret slots on top of your base to open the build menu, then select a turret to construct.
*   **Use Special Ability:** Click the special ability icon on the top-right of the screen when it's ready (not on cooldown).
*   **Evolve:** Click the "Evolve" button at the top-right of the screen once you have accumulated enough XP.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I get XP?**
    *   **A:** 每当你的单位击杀敌方单位时，你就会获得经验值（XP）。

*   **Q: What is the best unit in the game?**
    *   **A:** 虽然这取决于具体情况，但未来时代的"超级士兵"因其高生命值和伤害而被广泛认为是最强大的全能单位。在游戏早期，基础的棍棒人是性价比最高的。

*   **Q: Is it better to build more turrets or train more units?**
    *   **A:** 在游戏早期，混合使用最好。一两个炮塔提供稳定的防御，让你可以节省金币用于强大的进攻军队。在游戏后期，拥有完全升级的炮塔对生存至关重要。

*   **Q: Where can I play Age of War now that Flash is gone?**
    *   **A:** 许多游戏网站如CrazyGames、Armor Games和Kongregate现在使用Flash模拟器（如Ruffle）托管Age of War，使其在现代网络浏览器中完全可玩。iOS和Android应用商店也有移动版本。
