### Game Introduction

"Slither.io" is a popular multiplayer online game where players control a snake-like avatar, consuming glowing orbs to grow larger while avoiding collisions with other players. In this endless arena, players compete for dominance with the goal of becoming the biggest and longest snake.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **[KO]** **Safe Growth**: Focus on collecting small orbs in early game, avoiding contact with large snakes.
2.  **[KO]** **Cutting Tactics**: When you're large enough, try to cut off other snakes' paths to make them crash into you.
3.  **[KO]** **Boost Technique**: Use the boost function wisely to escape danger or capture prey, but note it consumes body length.
4.  **[KO]** **Border Utilization**: Use map boundaries to protect one side, reducing the risk of being surrounded.
