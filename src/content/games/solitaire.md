### Game Introduction

"Solitaire" is the classic single-player card game where players arrange cards in specific sequences and suits, aiming to move all cards to foundation piles and clear the tableau. This timeless puzzle game is widely popular for its simple-to-learn but strategy-requiring characteristics.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Prioritize Revealing Hidden Cards**: Prioritize moving cards that can reveal hidden cards, increasing available move options.
2.  **Use Empty Columns Wisely**: Empty columns can hold Kings and serve as important temporary storage space.
3.  **Plan Move Sequences**: Plan multi-step moves in advance to avoid blocking subsequent operations.
4.  **Foundation Pile Management**: Move cards to foundation piles at appropriate times, but be aware you might need these cards to help other moves.
5.  **Utilize Waste Pile**: Make good use of cards in the waste pile to complete necessary moves.

### How to Play

*   **Move Cards**: Click and drag cards to appropriate positions.
*   **Flip Cards**: Click on face-down cards at the top of piles to flip them.
*   **Auto-move**: Double-clicking cards may automatically move them to appropriate foundation piles (if possible).
*   **Undo**: Some versions provide undo functionality to reverse moves.

### Frequently Asked Questions

    **A**: Foundation piles are four empty spaces that need to be filled with cards by suit from A to K in order.

3.  **Q: What if the game is unsolvable?**

4.  **Q: How does the scoring system work?**
