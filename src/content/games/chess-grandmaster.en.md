### Detailed Game Introduction

Chess Grandmaster is a feature‑complete browser chess experience against AI or local opponents. Master the three phases: openings (development and king safety), middlegame (tactics like forks, pins, skewers), and endgames (king activity, opposition, basic mates). Adjustable difficulty helps you train calculation and pattern recognition.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Openings: Develop minor pieces, castle early, and fight for the center (e4/d4).
2.  Tactics: Always scan checks, captures, threats on every move (“CCT”).
3.  Structure: Avoid doubled/isolation if possible; create pawn majorities you can push.
4.  Endgames: Activate your king; know basic mates (KQ vs K, KR vs K) and pawn endings (opposition/zugzwang).
5.  Time control: Play simple, safe moves when low on time.
