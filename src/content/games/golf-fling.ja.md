### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Golf Fling is a fun and challenging physics-based puzzle game that reinvents the way you play golf. Instead of clubs, you use a simple pull-and-release mechanic to fling the golf ball across a variety of creative and tricky courses. Your goal is to get the ball into the hole in as few flings as possible. Navigate around obstacles, use the terrain to your advantage, and master the art of the fling to become a champion!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
