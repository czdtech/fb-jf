### Detailed Game Introduction

Pets Rush is a fast-paced and exciting match-3 puzzle game with an adorable animal theme. Unlike traditional level-based match-3 games, this is a game of survival. A wall of colorful pet blocks continuously rises from the bottom of the screen, and you must frantically make matches to keep it from reaching the top. Swap adjacent pets to create lines of three or more, trigger combos, and clear the board for as long as you can to achieve a high score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Stay Ahead of the Rise:** Your primary goal is to prevent any column from reaching the top of the screen. Always prioritize making matches in your tallest columns to push them back down.
2.  **Look for Combos:** The most effective way to clear the board is to set up chain reactions. When you make a match, new pets will fall into place. Look for opportunities where clearing one line will cause another match to form automatically. These combos clear more space and award more points.
3.  **Think Fast, Act Fast:** The wall of pets will rise faster as the game progresses. You need to quickly identify and execute matches to keep up with the increasing speed.
4.  **Special Blocks:** Keep an eye out for any special blocks or power-ups that might appear. These can help you clear large sections of the board in a pinch.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple swap controls.

*   **Swap Pets:** Click on a pet and then click on an adjacent pet to swap their positions. You can also click and drag one pet onto an adjacent one. A swap is only possible if it results in a match of three or more.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I lose the game?**
    *   **A:** The game ends immediately if any single column of pet blocks reaches the very top of the screen.

*   **Q: What is the best way to get a high score?**
    *   **A:** Survival and combos. The longer you last, the more points you'll get. Creating chain reactions where multiple matches happen in one move will give you a score multiplier and significantly boost your final score.

*   **Q: Is there a way to stop the blocks from rising?**
    *   **A:** The only way to stop them is to continuously make matches. Every time you make a successful match, the rising wall will pause for a moment.
