<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Hobo is a side‑scrolling beat ’em up known for slapstick violence and deliberately crude humor. You traverse urban stages, smashing enemies with punches, kicks, grapples, and unlockable combo strings. Environmental weapons, throwable objects, and stage hazards add variety, while boss encounters test crowd control and timing. Health and stamina management, plus learning enemy tells, are key to clearing waves without being overwhelmed.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Chain light/heavy attacks into discovered combos to increase damage and stunlock.
- Use pickups and thrown objects to thin groups from a distance.
- Learn boss patterns—dodge opening attacks, punish recovery windows.

### Controls
- Arrows to move; attack/jump/grab keys vary by host; combo inputs shown in‑game.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Keep enemies on one side; avoid getting surrounded.
- Grapple single targets to remove them quickly when mobs thin out.
- Save health items for post‑wave pickups, not mid‑crowd.
