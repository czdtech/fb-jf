### Overview
Crash Bandicoot is a browser‑playable Flash/platformer tribute to the classic series. Make your way through a short set of themed stages, break crates, collect crystals and fruit, and avoid TNT hazards. After obtaining five crystals, you face Ripper Roo in a boss fight; spinning iron crates at him ends the game upon victory.  

### How to Play
- Progress through linear stages while gathering crystals and fruit.  
- Break crates for items; avoid TNT and explosive crates.  
- Use the spin attack to destroy certain obstacles and defeat light enemies.  
- Reach the end of the level without falling into pits or traps.  

### Controls
- Arrow Keys: Move / Jump (Up) / Duck (Down)  
- Space: Spin attack (key may vary slightly by host)  

### Tips and Strategies
- Time jumps to clear moving platforms and gaps.  
- Spin into crates from a safe distance; never linger near TNT after activation.  
- Grab as many Wumpa fruit as possible for extra lives in some versions.  
- Boss levels emphasize pattern recognition—wait for openings, then spin.  

### FAQ
- Q: How many levels are there?  
  A: Five main stages; after collecting five crystals you fight Ripper Roo, then the game ends.  
- Q: Why doesn’t the jump or spin work?  
  A: Make sure the game canvas is focused; keys may vary slightly between hosts.  
- Q: Is progress saved?  
  A: Most Flash/browser versions do not save long‑term progress beyond the session.
