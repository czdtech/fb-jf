<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Google Snake updates the classic formula with clean visuals and optional modes. Eat fruit to grow while avoiding walls and your own tail. Speed rises as you survive longer; variant rules change board size, obstacles, and item effects.

- Adapt to special items/modes as enabled by the host.
