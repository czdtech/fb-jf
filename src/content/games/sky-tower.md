### Detailed Game Introduction

Sky Tower challenges you to drop moving floors onto a growing tower. Misalignments shear off overhangs, shrinking the platform. Clean timing produces tall, stable towers; sloppiness shrinks floors and ends runs early.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Center cue: Align to a background landmark to release consistently.
2.  Late‑release bias: Drop just after alignment passes the center to compensate for human reaction.
3.  Recovery floors: After a bad chop, slow down and re‑center before chasing height.
4.  Rhythm: Maintain a steady cadence rather than reacting frantically.
5.  Patience: Ignore coins during wobble; stabilize first.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click to drop floors; pause/replay via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My tower shrinks fast.
  
  A: You’re releasing early/late inconsistently; use a fixed visual cue.

- Q: Any way to recover?
  
  A: Yes — refocus on perfect centers for a few floors to rebuild width.

- Q: Is speed important?
  
  A: Consistency beats speed; height follows from clean centers.
