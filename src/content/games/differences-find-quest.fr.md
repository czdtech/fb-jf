### Detailed Game Introduction

Differences Find Quest challenges you to compare two images and spot subtle changes: missing objects, color swaps, flipped patterns, or size variations. Later levels add more differences, trick angles, and gentle time pressure.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Grid scan: Divide the image into 4–6 zones and sweep each zone methodically.
2.  **[FR]** Look for edges: Differences cluster at borders, shadows, and repeated textures.
3.  **[FR]** Zoom if possible to check small details.
4.  **[FR]** Save hints for the final 1–2 stubborn differences.
5.  **[FR]** Take short breaks to reset your visual focus.

### Controls Guide

- Tap differences on either image; wrong taps may cost time.
- Use hints sparingly; some modes penalize excessive hints.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I’m stuck on the last difference — what now?

A: Step back, re‑scan edges and repeated patterns, then use a hint if available.

- Q: Do I lose time for mistakes?

A: Many modes deduct time or score for mis‑clicks; be deliberate.

- Q: Any trick for tiny color shifts?

A: Squint slightly or zoom — it can reveal subtle contrast differences.
