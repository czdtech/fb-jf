### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Solitaire 2048 converts merge logic into a card stream. You place cards (2, 4, 8…) into columns; adjacent equals merge to the next value. The trick is sequencing so merges cascade and free space rather than clog lanes.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Anchor column: Keep the highest value centralized for lateral access.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Feeder management: Use side lanes to stage pairs before feeding center.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Spike control: Flatten tall spikes first to avoid dead columns.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Trigger timing: Drop the triggering card only after both neighbors are set.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Trash lane: Dedicate one edge to off‑cycle cards.

### Controls Guide

- Click a column to place current card; undo/hints if available.
