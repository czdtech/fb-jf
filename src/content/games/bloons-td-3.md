### Game Introduction

Bloons TD 3 is a pivotal entry in the tower defense series that significantly expanded upon its predecessors. The core gameplay remains focused on placing monkey towers to pop waves of "Bloons" before they complete a designated path. This installment, however, introduced several key features that became staples of the series.

The game offers multiple tracks and three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), each with a different number of starting lives and tower costs. Players earn money by popping Bloons, which is then used to buy and upgrade eight different towers. A major change in BTD3 is that each tower has its own unique upgrades, and players can purchase all available upgrades for a single tower, unlike later games which introduced branching paths.

**Key Features of Bloons TD 3:**
-   **New Towers:** The roster was expanded to eight towers, introducing the **Boomerang Thrower**, **Spike-o-pult**, and the crucial support tower, the **Monkey Beacon**.
-   **The MOAB:** This game marks the very first appearance of the **M.O.A.B.** (Massive Ornary Air Blimp). This tough, slow-moving blimp acts as a "boss" on the final round of Easy and Medium difficulties, requiring a powerful, focused defense to take down.
-   **Multiple Tracks & Difficulties:** Provided much more replayability than previous titles.
-   **Full Upgrade System:** Players could fully upgrade a tower by purchasing all of its available enhancements, making for very powerful late-game units.
-   **Persistent Bloon Immunities:** The concepts of **Lead** (immune to sharp), **Black** (immune to explosions), and **White** (immune to freeze) Bloons are central to the game's strategy.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Balanced Start:** Begin with Dart Monkeys and Tack Shooters. Upgrade your Dart Monkeys to "Piercing Darts" quickly. A Boomerang Thrower is excellent for covering curved sections of the track.
-   **Prepare for Lead Bloons (Round 26):** Lead Bloons make their first appearance on round 26. You **must** have a Bomb Tower with the "Bigger Bombs" upgrade ready to deal with them. No other early-game tower can pop them.
-   **Leverage the Monkey Beacon:** The Monkey Beacon is one of the most important towers. It increases the range of all towers within its radius. Place it in a central location and build a cluster of your most powerful towers around it. The "Super Range" upgrade for the Beacon is a top priority.
-   **The "Beacon Super Monkey" Strategy:** The most dominant late-game strategy involves placing a Super Monkey right next to a fully upgraded Monkey Beacon. The massive range boost turns the Super Monkey into a full-screen map clearer, essential for handling the dense final waves.
-   **How to Beat the MOAB:** The MOAB appears on round 50 (Easy/Medium). It has a lot of health. The best way to destroy it is with high, single-target damage.
    -   A Super Monkey (especially one buffed by a Beacon) is the best option.
    -   A cluster of several Bomb Towers set to "target strong" can also focus fire on it effectively.
    -   Remember, after the MOAB pops, it releases several Ceramic Bloons, so make sure your defense can handle the aftermath.
-   **Spike-o-pults for Straights:** Place Spike-o-pults at the beginning of long, straight paths. Their spiked balls can travel a long distance, popping multiple Bloons along the way.

### Controls Guide

The game uses a simple and intuitive point-and-click interface.

-   **Select & Place Tower:** Click a tower from the right-hand panel, then click on a valid spot on the map to place it.
-   **Upgrade Tower:** Click on an existing tower on the map to see its available upgrades in the panel. Click an upgrade to purchase it.
-   **Start Round/Fast Forward:** Use the buttons at the bottom right to start the next round or to speed up the game.
-   **Hotkeys:** Use the number keys (1-8) to select towers. The spacebar starts the next round.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. I can't pop the grey (Lead) Bloons! What do I do?**
> Lead Bloons are immune to all sharp projectiles (darts, tacks, boomerangs). You must use a Bomb Tower to pop them.

**2. What is the big blue blimp at the end of the game?**
> That is the M.O.A.B. (Massive Ornary Air Blimp). It is a very durable boss Bloon. It moves slowly but can absorb a lot of damage before it pops.

**3. Why should I use the Monkey Beacon? It doesn't attack.**
> The Monkey Beacon is a support tower. It provides a crucial range boost to all towers placed near it. A Super Monkey next to a Beacon can cover almost the entire map, making it far more effective.

**4. How many rounds are there?**
> -   **Easy Difficulty:** 50 rounds.
> -   **Medium Difficulty:** 50 rounds.
> -   **Hard Difficulty:** 75 rounds.

**5. What's the difference between Black and White Bloons?**
> Black Bloons are immune to explosions (from Bomb Towers). White Bloons are immune to being frozen (by Ice Towers). You need other towers like Dart Monkeys or Boomerangs to handle them.
