### Detailed Game Introduction

Get 10 Ultimate is a simple yet deeply strategic number puzzle game. The board is filled with numbered tiles, and your goal is to combine them to create higher numbers. You do this by tapping on a group of two or more adjacent, identical numbers. This merges the entire group into a single new tile with a value that is one higher. The initial challenge is to reach the number 10, but the ultimate goal is to continue merging for as long as possible to achieve the highest number and score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Think Before You Tap:** Every tap changes the layout of the board. Before you merge a group, consider how the tiles above will fall and what new groups might form. A good move can set up an even better move.
2.  **[DE]** **Create Large Groups:** While you can merge a group of just two tiles, it's much more efficient to create and merge larger groups. Try to maneuver tiles so that you have big clusters of the same number next to each other before you tap.
3.  **[DE]** **Don't Isolate High Numbers:** Be careful not to create a single high number that is surrounded by many different, lower numbers. This can make it very difficult to create another high number to merge it with, effectively blocking a large part of your board.
4.  **[DE]** **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches near the bottom of the board will cause the most tiles to shift, increasing the chances of creating new, unplanned matches as tiles fall into place.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with a single click or tap.

*   **[DE]** **Merge Numbers:** Click on any group of two or more adjacent tiles that have the same number. The group will merge into the spot where you clicked.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The first goal is to successfully create a '10' tile. After that, the goal is to continue merging to the highest number and score you can before the board gets locked.

*   **[DE]** **Q: How does the game end?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The game ends when there are no more possible moves, which means there are no two adjacent tiles with the same number anywhere on the board.

*   **[DE]** **Q: Does the new tile appear in a random spot?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** No, the new, higher-numbered tile will appear in the specific spot within the group that you clicked on.
