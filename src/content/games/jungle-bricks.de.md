### Detailed Game Introduction

Jungle Bricks is a captivating and modern take on the classic brick-breaker genre. Set in a vibrant jungle, the game challenges players to clear an ever-advancing wall of numbered bricks. Unlike traditional brick-breakers where you control a paddle, here you aim and shoot a volley of balls from a fixed point. Each brick has a durability number that you must reduce to zero to destroy it. The goal is to survive for as long as possible by strategically clearing the bricks before they reach the bottom of the screen.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Aim for Angles:** The key to a high score is maximizing the number of hits per shot. Avoid shooting straight up. Instead, aim for the sides of the screen or gaps between bricks to create complex ricochets. A well-aimed shot can have your balls bouncing around the screen for a long time, clearing multiple bricks at once.
2.  **[DE]** **Prioritize High-Threat Bricks:** Always focus on the bricks that are closest to the bottom of the screen. A single brick touching the bottom line will end your game, so clearing these should be your top priority.
3.  **[DE]** **Look for Power-ups:** Some bricks may contain power-ups, such as extra balls. Targeting these can dramatically increase your clearing power for subsequent turns.
4.  **[DE]** **Plan for the Descent:** After every shot, all bricks on the screen will move one step down. Keep this in mind when planning your shots. A safe-looking board can become dangerous in just a few turns if you don't clear bricks efficiently.

### Controls Guide

The game uses simple, one-touch controls.

*   **[DE]** **Aim:** Click and hold the left mouse button (or your finger on a touch screen) and drag to aim. A guideline will appear showing the initial trajectory of your shot.
*   **[DE]** **Shoot:** Release the mouse button (or your finger) to fire the balls.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: What do the numbers on the bricks mean?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The number represents the brick's "health" or the number of times it must be hit by a ball before it is destroyed.

*   **[DE]** **Q: How do you lose the game?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The game ends if any brick successfully reaches the bottom line of the play area.

*   **[DE]** **Q: How can I get more balls?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** Look for special blocks with a "+" or similar icon on them. Hitting and destroying these blocks will often add more balls to your volley for the next shot.
