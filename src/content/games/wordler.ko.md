### Detailed Game Introduction

Wordler follows the modern five‑letter deduction format: each guess yields color feedback (correct letter/place, correct letter/wrong place, absent). Optimal play prunes the search space with informed guesses instead of random stabs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Strong opener: Use a high‑coverage starter with common vowels/consonants (e.g., SLATE/CRANE/ROAST).
2.  **[KO]** Letter accounting: Track confirmed/excluded letters explicitly; avoid re‑testing dead letters.
3.  **[KO]** Position logic: Fix green letters, permute yellows across remaining slots.
4.  **[KO]** Frequency bias: Favor common digrams (TH, CH, SH, ST) and endings (‑ER, ‑ED, ‑ING).
5.  **[KO]** Endgame pruning: Before final guesses, shortlist all valid permutations to avoid whiffs.

### Controls Guide

- Type and submit guesses; review color feedback; limited attempts per puzzle.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I get multiple possibles late — how to pick?

A: Choose a diagnostic word that tests the most uncertain letters/positions.

- Q: Are plurals allowed?

A: Depends on dictionary; many allow plurals sparingly.
