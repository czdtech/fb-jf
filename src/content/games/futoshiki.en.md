### Detailed Game Introduction

Futoshiki ("not equal") is a Latin‑square logic puzzle like Sudoku but with inequality signs (>, <) between neighboring cells. You must place digits so each row/column contains all numbers exactly once and every inequality is satisfied. The signs create strong chains that power elegant deductions.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Inequality chains: A>B>C means A≥C+2; pencil candidates accordingly.
2.  Extremes: A>…>B bounds A high and B low; use 1/Max eliminations on chain ends.
3.  Row/column scans: Apply Latin constraints to prune candidates aggressively.
4.  Contradiction loops: Assume a value on tight cells; backtrack if an inequality breaks or row/col duplicates.
5.  Symmetry: Balanced puzzles often have mirrored inequality structures — exploit them.

### Controls Guide

- `Tap` a cell to `enter` candidates/values; toggle pencil mode; undo/redo.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:futoshiki:i-cant-progress-any-tip-26670f59 -->
  Q: I can’t progress — any tip?
  
  A: Expand inequality chains into explicit bounds (e.g., if 5>□>3 then middle ∈ {4}); combine with row/col hits.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:futoshiki:are-guesses-required-13834711 -->
  Q: Are guesses required?
  
  A: Good sets are solvable logically; at worst use controlled assumptions with quick backtrack.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:futoshiki:difference-vs-sudoku-89f94240 -->
  Q: Difference vs Sudoku?
  
  A: Inequalities add directed constraints, enabling stronger forced moves.
