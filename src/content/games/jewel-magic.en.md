### Detailed Game Introduction

Jewel Magic is a classic and captivating match-3 puzzle game that invites you into a world of sparkling gems and enchanting challenges. The core objective is to swap adjacent jewels to create a line of three or more identical gems, causing them to vanish and score points. With hundreds of levels, each presenting a unique goal, players must think strategically to create powerful special jewels, trigger dazzling chain reactions, and solve every puzzle presented to them.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Master the Special Gems:** To pass the toughest levels, you must create and utilize special gems. These are formed by matching more than three jewels at once:
    *   **Lightning Jewel:** Match 4 jewels in a line to create a jewel that can clear an entire row or column.
    *   **Bomb Jewel:** Match 5 jewels in an L or T shape to create a bomb that explodes and destroys a block of surrounding jewels.
    *   **Rainbow Jewel:** Match 5 jewels in a straight line to create a powerful rainbow jewel. Swap it with any adjacent jewel to remove all jewels of that color from the board.

2.  **Combine for Power:** The ultimate strategy is to combine two special jewels. Swapping a bomb and a lightning jewel, for instance, creates a massive cross-shaped blast. Experiment with different combinations to see their powerful effects.

3.  **Focus on the Goal:** Each level has a specific objective, such as reaching a target score, clearing all the jelly from behind the jewels, or dropping special items to the bottom. Always focus your efforts on achieving that goal within the limited number of moves.

4.  **Start from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the grid increases the chance of causing a cascade, where new jewels fall into place and create automatic matches. This can help you clear the board and reach your goal much faster.

### Controls Guide

The game is controlled using simple mouse or touch gestures.

*   **Swap Jewels:** Click and drag a jewel to swap it with an adjacent one. The swap will only complete if it forms a valid match of three or more identical jewels.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I get past levels with frozen or chained jewels?**
    *   **A:** You must make a match that includes the frozen or chained jewel. This will break the ice or the chain, freeing the jewel to be used in future matches.

*   **Q: What is the best way to get a high score?**
    *   **A:** Create as many special jewels and combos as possible. Triggering long chain reactions and clearing a large number of jewels in a single move will result in a much higher score.

*   **Q: What happens when I run out of moves?**
    *   **A:** If you don't complete the level's objective before your moves run out, you will lose a life and must restart the level.
