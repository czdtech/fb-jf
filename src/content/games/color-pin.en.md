### Detailed Game Introduction

Color Pin asks you to fire pins into a spinning circle. Avoid hitting existing pins, and in color modes, land on matching segments. Rotation speed and direction shifts keep timing tight, rewarding rhythm and patience over spam.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Identify rotation cycles and shoot at a consistent phase.
2.  Prioritize wide gaps first; leave tight gaps for slow spins.
3.  Don’t chase missed windows — wait for the next clean pass.
4.  In color modes, pre‑aim the correct segment and shoot only on alignment.
5.  Recover rhythm after misses before continuing.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click to fire a pin; some variants allow holding to adjust.
- Pause/Restart available via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I keep colliding with pins — why?
  
  A: You’re desynced. Watch a full rotation, then resume at a consistent beat.

- Q: Does speed change mid‑level?
  
  A: Often yes; be ready for step‑ups and direction flips.

- Q: Any trick for color segments?
  
  A: Shoot only when your target color aligns; forcing shots creates avoidable crashes.
