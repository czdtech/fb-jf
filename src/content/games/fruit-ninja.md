### Overview
Swipe to slice fruit mid‑air. Avoid bombs and aim for combos and criticals. Modes vary by host (classic, arcade, zen).

### How to Play
- Draw swift, clean lines through multiple fruit for combo points.
- Let bombs pass; hitting one ends runs or deducts heavily.
- Time frenzy bananas (when present) for massive chains.

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch swipes to slice; pause/retry via UI.

### Tips
- Aim to intersect as many fruit trajectories as possible per stroke.
- Use diagonal swipes; they cross more spawn arcs.
- In Zen‑style modes, optimize pathing since bombs are absent.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I score combos consistently?  
  A: Wait half a beat to line up two or more fruit before swiping.
- Q: What happens if I hit a bomb?  
  A: Depending on mode, the run ends or you lose points/time.
- Q: Are there different modes available?  
  A: Many hosts include Classic, Arcade (with power‑ups), and Zen.
