### Detailed Game Introduction

Farm Block Puzzle is a relaxing and addictive puzzle game based on the classic 10x10 formula, all set in a charming farm environment. The goal is to strategically place different block shapes onto a 10x10 grid. When you successfully form a complete line of blocks, either horizontally or vertically, the line will be cleared. The game challenges you to keep placing blocks and clearing lines for as long as possible to achieve a high score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Plan for the Pieces You Have:** The game gives you three block shapes at a time. Before placing one, always consider if you have a viable spot for the other two. This prevents you from getting stuck with a piece that won't fit.
2.  **Aim for Combos:** Clearing one line is good, but clearing multiple lines at once with a single piece is a "combo" and will give you a much higher score. Always look for opportunities to complete two or more lines simultaneously.
3.  **Keep the Board Clean:** Try to avoid leaving single, isolated empty holes in your grid. A clean and open board gives you more flexibility to place larger and more awkward pieces later on.
4.  **No Rotations:** Remember, the blocks cannot be rotated. You must use them in the orientation they are given, which is the core challenge of the puzzle.
