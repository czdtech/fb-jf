### Detailed Game Introduction

Slime.io is a chaotic and satisfying 3D arcade game that belongs to the popular ".io" genre of multiplayer games. You control a small slime in a bustling city with one simple goal: become the biggest. You do this by sliding around the map and absorbing everything in your path that is smaller than you—from streetlights and cars to entire buildings. Compete against other players, absorb the smaller ones, and avoid being eaten by the giants to dominate the leaderboard before the timer runs out!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Start Small:** When the round begins, you are small and vulnerable. Focus on absorbing small objects first, like people, fences, and benches. This will quickly increase your size.
2.  **Grow to Consume:** As you get bigger, you can absorb larger objects. Move from cars to trucks and eventually to entire skyscrapers. The bigger the object, the more points you get and the faster you grow.
3.  **Player vs. Player:** Pay close attention to the other slimes on the map. You can absorb any player who is smaller than you for a massive score boost. Conversely, you must run away from any player who is bigger than you, or they will absorb you!
4.  **Watch the Clock:** Each round is timed. Your goal is to have the highest score when the timer hits zero. Be as efficient as possible in your consumption to stay at the top.
