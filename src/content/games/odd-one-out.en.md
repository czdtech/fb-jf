### Detailed Game Introduction

Odd One Out is a puzzle game that challenges your observation and categorization skills. In each level, you are presented with a group of items, and your task is to identify the one that doesn't fit with the others based on a certain rule or category.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Examine the Items:** Carefully look at all the items presented in the group.
2.  **Find the Connection:** Determine the common characteristic that most of the items share. This could be color, shape, size, category (like fruits or animals), or another attribute.
3.  **Identify the Odd One:** The item that does not share this common characteristic is the "odd one out."
4.  **Select the Item:** Click or tap on the item you believe is the odd one out to proceed to the next level.

### Controls Guide

*   **Mouse/Touch:** Use the mouse or touch screen to select the item that you think is the odd one out.
