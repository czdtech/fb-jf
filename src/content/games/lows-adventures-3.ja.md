### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The third entry sharpens platforming with trickier timing windows, moving hazards, and additional secret routes. Expect switch puzzles, hidden keys, and off‑screen passages that reward careful exploration and efficient routing.

### How to Play
- Clear main exits first, then return for secrets and time medals.
- Use moving platforms to set up longer jumps.
- Track which keys open which doors to avoid backtracking.
