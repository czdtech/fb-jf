### Detailed Game Introduction

Zoo Boom is a vibrant and engaging match-2 puzzle game that takes you on an exciting adventure through a colorful zoo. Your mission is to tap and blast groups of two or more identical animal blocks to clear them from the board. Each level presents unique challenges and objectives, such as collecting a certain number of specific animals, clearing obstacles, or reaching a target score within a limited number of moves. Unleash powerful boosters by matching larger groups of animals to create spectacular chain reactions and achieve high scores.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Look for Large Groups:** While you can match just two identical blocks, aim for larger groups of three or more. Matching more blocks at once will give you more points and help you create powerful boosters.
2.  **[KO]** **Create Boosters:** Matching five or more blocks will typically create special boosters like rockets, bombs, or color-clearing items. These are crucial for clearing difficult sections and achieving high scores.
3.  **[KO]** **Combine Boosters:** The real power comes from combining two adjacent boosters. For example, combining two rockets can clear a huge area, while combining a bomb with a color-clearing item can be devastatingly effective.
4.  **[KO]** **Prioritize Objectives:** Always keep an eye on the level's specific objectives. Sometimes it's better to make a smaller match that helps you achieve an objective rather than a large match that doesn't.
5.  **[KO]** **Plan Your Moves:** Don't just tap randomly. Think a few moves ahead to see how your current tap will affect the board and set up future matches or booster creations.

### Controls Guide

*   **[KO]** **Tap to Blast:** Simply click or tap on a group of two or more identical, adjacent animal blocks to clear them.
