### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Kings and Queens wraps a castle‑restoration story around classic match‑3. Each chapter introduces new blockers (chains, marble slabs, fog) and scene goals (collect crowns, break seals). You spend earned stars to renovate rooms, unlocking boosters for harder boards.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Board control: Clear central blockers first to open space for combos.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Booster timing: Save hammers/rockets for late‑board choke points.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Combo planning: Merge power‑ups (bomb+line/color clears) right before tight goals.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Star economy: Spend on boosters that directly help your current hurdle.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Move math: Count remaining blockers vs moves and play for the objective, not points.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to swap; tap boosters to use; scene menu to renovate with stars.
