### Detailed Game Introduction

Idle Explorers is an addictive idle management and clicker game where you take on the role of a mining tycoon. Your goal is to build a vast exploration empire by managing a team of workers who dig for valuable resources. You start with a single explorer in a basic mine shaft and must use the income they generate to upgrade your operation, hire more workers, automate processes by hiring managers, and eventually unlock new, more profitable mines across different worlds.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Core Loop:** The gameplay loop is simple but compelling: Your workers dig automatically, generating cash. You use that cash to buy upgrades. Those upgrades make you earn cash faster, allowing you to afford even bigger upgrades. This cycle continues as you expand your empire.
2.  **Prioritize Upgrades:** In the early game, focus on upgrading the speed and capacity of your workers and shafts. A good strategy is to keep your mine shafts, elevator, and warehouse at roughly the same level to ensure a smooth and balanced workflow without bottlenecks.
3.  **Automate with Managers:** The key to any idle game is automation. As soon as you can afford them, hire managers for each part of your operation (the mine shafts, the elevator, and the warehouse). Once a manager is in place, that part of the operation will run automatically, earning you money even when you are not clicking or have the game open.
4.  **Expand and Prestige:** Your main long-term goal is to earn enough money to unlock the next mine or world. Each new location offers significantly higher income potential. Many idle games also feature a "Prestige" system, where you can reset your progress in exchange for a permanent boost to all future earnings.

### Controls Guide

The game is played entirely with mouse clicks or taps.

*   **Upgrade:** Click on the upgrade buttons for your mine shafts, elevator, and warehouse to level them up.
*   **Hire Managers:** Click on the manager icons when you have enough funds to automate a process.
*   **Navigate:** Use the map or world buttons to switch between your different mines.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: What should I upgrade first?**
    *   **A:** A balanced approach is best. There's no point in having super-fast miners if your elevator can't keep up. Try to upgrade your shafts, elevator, and warehouse in tandem to keep the resources flowing smoothly.

*   **Q: What do managers do?**
    *   **A:** Managers are essential for idle income. They automate the work of their respective departments, so you continue to earn money even when you are offline.

*   **Q: Should I spend my money right away or save it?**
    *   **A:** In idle games, it's almost always best to reinvest your money into upgrades as soon as you can afford them. Each upgrade increases your earning rate, which means you'll be able to afford the next upgrade even faster. This exponential growth is the core of the game.
