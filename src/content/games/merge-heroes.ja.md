### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Merge Heroes is a captivating blend of merge-puzzle mechanics and auto-battle strategy. In this game, you are tasked with defending your kingdom from hordes of monsters. You build your army not just by recruiting, but by merging identical heroes to evolve them into more powerful warriors. Strategically place your merged heroes on the battlefield and watch as they automatically defend against wave after wave of enemies.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Buy and Merge:** Use your gold to buy basic heroes, which appear on your reserve board. The core of the game is to drag and drop one hero onto another identical hero. This merges them into a single, higher-level hero with improved stats.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Deploy Your Army:** Drag your strongest heroes from the reserve board onto the battle grid. Once placed, they will automatically engage any enemies that come within their range. You have a limited number of slots on the battle grid, so choose your active heroes wisely.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Hero Types:** Pay attention to different hero types. Melee heroes (like knights) must be on the front lines to engage enemies, while ranged heroes (like archers) can attack from the back. A balanced formation is key.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Manage Your Gold:** You earn gold automatically as your heroes defeat monsters. Reinvest this gold quickly into buying more basic heroes so you can continue merging and upgrading your army to keep up with the increasingly difficult enemy waves.
