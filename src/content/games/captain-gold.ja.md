### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Captain Gold follows the timeless gold‑miner formula: swing a hook across the screen and release at the right moment to snag gold nuggets and treasures. Heavy objects pull slowly, light ones reel in faster. Stages set cash targets and time limits, with shop upgrades between rounds.
