### Detailed Game Introduction

Mahjong Connect differs from classic mahjong solitaire: you must link matching tiles with a path that bends at most twice (i.e., ≤2 right‑angle turns) without crossing other tiles. Missions add locked tiles, fog, and bombs that require priority handling and clean board management.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Edge hunting: Edges and corners yield the most legal paths — scan them first.
2.  **[DE]** Pair pruning: Remove tiles that open corridors and expose the center.
3.  **[DE]** Turn budgeting: Prefer straight or one‑turn paths to preserve options.
4.  **[DE]** Hazard priority: Clear bombs/locks before they block vital lanes.
5.  **[DE]** Time economy: Use hints only when the board stagnates.

### Controls Guide

- Click two identical tiles to connect if a legal path exists; hints/shuffles per UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: No moves — is it over?

A: Use shuffle if allowed; otherwise restart to avoid early dead lanes.

- Q: Do diagonals connect?

A: No — only orthogonal paths with up to two turns.

- Q: Any symbol confusion tips?

A: Learn suits and season/flower symbols; zoom helps on dense art.
