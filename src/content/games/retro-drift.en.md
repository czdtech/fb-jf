### Detailed Game Introduction

Retro Drift is a minimalist top‑down driving game focused on controlled slides. Courses favor flowing lines and corner linking—light throttle, counter‑steer timing, and exit speed determine lap times and score multipliers.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Enter slow, exit fast: Sacrifice a bit of entry speed to maximize exit traction and next corner setup.
2.  Feather throttle: Short pulses keep traction while preserving the slide.
3.  One drift, many corners: Link consecutive corners by planning line and throttle in advance.
4.  Recover early: If the rear steps out too far, reduce throttle and steer into the slide before it spins.
5.  Learn layouts: Repetition builds muscle memory for braking points and apex timing.

### Controls Guide

- Steer: A/D or Left/Right.
- Throttle/Brake: W/S or Up/Down.
- Handbrake (if available): Space for sharper rotation.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:retro-drift:i-keep-spinningwhy-68807685 -->
  I keep spinning—why? Too much throttle or late counter‑steer; soften inputs and react earlier.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:retro-drift:best-way-to-link-corners-be5683e8 -->
  Best way to link corners? Focus on exit of corner A to set a line into corner B; avoid full traction resets between them.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:retro-drift:are-upgrades-available-67e52001 -->
  Are upgrades available? Some modes offer car unlocks; otherwise, skill and consistency drive improvement.
