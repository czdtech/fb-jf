### Detailed Game Introduction

Merge Bistro blends merge‑2 mechanics with light restaurant management. Generate base items (flour, milk, eggs), merge into higher‑tier ingredients (dough, batter), then craft dishes to satisfy orders. Storage limits and production cooldowns force clever board economy.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Queue reading: Prep items for upcoming orders to avoid idle waits.
2.  Board economy: Keep a lane for bases and a lane for high tiers; avoid clogging.
3.  Merge discipline: Only merge when you can immediately use or free space.
4.  Generators: Upgrade generators that feed the most common recipes first.
5.  Delivery timing: Turn in batches to trigger combo rewards.

### Controls Guide

- Drag identical items together to merge; tap stations to craft; deliver via order panel.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My board is full — help?
  
  A: Scrap low‑value clutter, merge toward active orders, and expand storage when possible.

- Q: What to upgrade first?
  
  A: Base generators tied to staple recipes (e.g., flour/milk) for consistent flow.

- Q: Do I need to rush merges?
  
  A: No — plan to avoid dead‑ends; merging without purpose clogs the board.
