### Detailed Game Introduction

Lucky Vegas Blackjack offers fast blackjack rounds with standard rules: reach 21 or best the dealer without busting. Face cards count as 10; aces as 1 or 11. Use basic strategy vs the dealer upcard and avoid risky side bets with higher house edges.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Basic chart: Stand hard 17+, hit ≤11, double 10–11 vs weak upcards.
2.  Soft hands: Hit soft 17; double soft 18 vs weak upcards when allowed.
3.  Splits: Split A/8; don’t split 10/5; follow table rules for others.
4.  Bankroll: Flat bet sizing; stop after win target or loss limit.
5.  Side bets: Treat as entertainment, not EV.
