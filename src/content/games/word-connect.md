Word Connect is a popular and relaxing word puzzle game that challenges players to form words by connecting letters. Typically, a set of letters is arranged in a circular pattern, and players swipe their finger (or mouse) across them to spell out words. The goal is to find all the hidden words that fit into a crossword-style grid above.

- **Objective:** Fill in all the blank spaces in the crossword grid by finding the correct words.
- **Bonus Words:** Find words that are not part of the main puzzle to earn extra coins.
