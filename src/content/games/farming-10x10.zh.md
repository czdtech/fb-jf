### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Farming 10x10 is a calm shape‑placement puzzle on a 10×10 grid. You receive sets of three pieces; place them to complete rows/columns and score clears. The run ends when no legal placements remain, so the art is in preserving flexibility while constructing multi‑line clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Keep the center breathable; tidy edges gradually to avoid single‑cell traps.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Reserve a pocket sized for the most awkward triominoes.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Place the hardest piece first when the board is crowded.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Build two‑line setups so one placement scores double clears.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Avoid creating 1×n “spines” that only fit sticks.

### Controls Guide

- Drag pieces to the board; release to place; some modes allow rotate.
- Undo/Reset if provided.
