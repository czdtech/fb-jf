### Detailed Game Introduction

99 Balls 3D is a highly addictive, physics-based puzzle shooter that combines elements of Breakout and Bubble Shooter. Your goal is to destroy a series of numbered balls that slowly descend from the top of the screen. You shoot a stream of smaller balls from the bottom, and the number on each target ball indicates how many hits it needs to be destroyed. The key to the game is to aim your shots perfectly to create long chain reactions of bounces, clearing the board before the numbered balls reach the bottom.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Master the Bank Shot:** Never shoot directly at a single target. The goal is to aim your stream of balls at an angle so that they bounce off the walls and other balls as many times as possible. A single, well-aimed shot can result in hundreds of hits.
2.  **[ES]** **Collect the Rings:** As you play, white rings will appear. Hitting these is your top priority. Each ring you collect adds one more ball to your shooting stream, dramatically increasing your firepower for all future shots.
3.  **[ES]** **Prioritize High-Number Balls:** The balls with the highest numbers are the biggest threat. Try to position your shots so that your stream of balls will hit them multiple times.
4.  **[ES]** **Don't Let Them Reach the Bottom:** After each shot, the balls will move one step closer to the bottom. If any numbered ball reaches the bottom line, the game is over.

### Controls Guide

*   **Aim:** Move your mouse to control the aiming guideline. This shows the initial trajectory of your shot.
*   **Shoot:** Click the left mouse button to fire your stream of balls.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: What do the numbers on the balls mean?**
    *   **A:** This is the ball's "health." It indicates how many times the ball must be hit before it is destroyed.

*   **Q: How do I get more balls to shoot?**
    *   **A:** By hitting the white rings that appear on the screen. Each ring you collect permanently adds one ball to your stream for the rest of the game.

*   **Q: What are the stars for?**
    *   **A:** Collecting stars allows you to unlock new skins and weapon types from the main menu, adding a fun cosmetic element to the game.
