### Game Introduction

Block Champ is a strategic puzzle game played on a 10x10 grid. It combines the line-clearing mechanics of classic block puzzle games with unique special blocks to create a more dynamic challenge. The objective is to score as many points as possible by strategically placing a variety of given block shapes onto the grid.

When a complete horizontal or vertical line is formed, that line is cleared from the board, freeing up space. The game provides the player with three block shapes at a time. The game ends when none of the three currently available shapes can be placed on the grid.

What sets Block Champ apart are its special blocks:
-   **Lightning Blocks:** Some pieces will have a lightning bolt icon on one of their squares. When the line (row or column) containing this specific square is cleared, the lightning bolt activates and clears the entire perpendicular line as well.
-   **Ice Blocks:** These appear on the board as obstacles. To remove an ice block, you must clear the line it is in twice. The first clear breaks the ice, revealing a normal block underneath. The second clear removes the block and the space.

The game requires foresight and careful space management to achieve a high score.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Keep Your Options Open:** Avoid creating single, isolated empty squares. These "holes" are very difficult to fill, as you must wait for a 1x1 block, which is rare. Try to keep the board as flat and open as possible.
-   **Use Large Pieces First:** When you are given large, awkward pieces (like the 3x3 square or the 5-block straight line), try to place them as soon as a good opportunity arises. Hoarding them will quickly lead to a situation where they no longer fit.
-   **Plan for Combos:** Always look for opportunities to clear a row and a column simultaneously with a single piece. This not only scores more points but is also much more efficient at clearing space.
-   **Strategic Use of Lightning Blocks:** A lightning block is a powerful tool. Don't just place it anywhere. If you have a lightning block that clears a column, try placing it in a column that is messy and difficult to complete normally. This can save you from a tight spot.
-   **Prioritize Clearing Ice Blocks:** Ice blocks are a major threat because they clog up the board and require double the effort to remove. Make it your top priority to clear the lines they occupy. Letting them accumulate can quickly end your game.
-   **Think in Threes:** Always consider all three pieces available to you before making a move. Sometimes the best move isn't placing the easiest piece, but placing one piece in a way that sets up perfect spots for the other two.

### Controls Guide

The game features very simple drag-and-drop controls, suitable for both mouse and touch devices.

-   **Select a Piece:** Click and hold (or tap and hold) one of the three available block shapes at the bottom of the screen.
-   **Place the Piece:** Drag the selected shape onto the 10x10 grid. If the placement is valid, the squares will be highlighted.
-   **Confirm Placement:** Release the mouse button (or lift your finger) to drop the piece into the highlighted position.

**Important Note:** The pieces cannot be rotated. You must use them in the orientation they are given.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. Can I rotate the blocks?**
> No, rotation is not a feature in Block Champ. This is a core part of the challenge, forcing you to work with the shapes exactly as they are presented.

**2. What do the lightning bolts do exactly?**
> A lightning bolt is on a single square within a larger piece. When you complete the line (row OR column) that this specific square is in, the lightning activates. If you completed a row, it will clear the entire column it was in. If you completed a column, it will clear the entire row it was in.

**3. How do I get rid of the frozen or ice blocks?**
> You must clear the line containing the ice block two times. The first time you complete the line, the ice will break, but the block underneath remains. The second time you complete that same line, the block will be removed like any normal clear.

**4. Why did the game end even though I have space on the board?**
> The game ends when there is no valid position on the board for ANY of the three pieces you are currently holding. Even if the board looks mostly empty, if none of your specific shapes can fit into the available gaps, the game is over.
