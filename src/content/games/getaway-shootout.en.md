<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Getaway Shootout is a competitive physics platformer where characters lurch forward with alternating hops. Each round drops you into a side‑scrolling map full of ladders, moving platforms, and weapon crates. The goal is to reach the extraction point first while using slapstick guns and gadgets to disrupt opponents. The awkward locomotion is the point: mastering hop timing, momentum on slopes, and mid‑air direction changes wins races.

### How to Play
- Alternate hops to build speed; use short taps for micro‑steps and long holds for vaults.
- Grab crates for weapons like pistols, rocket launchers, or gadgets; use them sparingly.
- Learn map shortcuts and moving platform cycles to stay ahead.

### Controls
- Two keys to hop left/right; separate keys to use items (keybinds vary by host); supports local 2‑player.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- On slopes, time longer holds to convert vertical gain into forward speed.
- Fire weapons at chokepoints or while an opponent jumps—knockback is strongest mid‑air.
- Practice starts: early acceleration often decides close races.
