### Detailed Game Introduction

Sugar Heroes leans into combo‑heavy match‑3 with candy‑themed blockers and animated heroes. Goals range from clearing jelly to delivering ingredients; power‑up merges (bomb+line/color clears) are crucial for dense layouts.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Focus goals: Clear blockers or collect items before pure scoring.
2.  Bottom cascades: Work low for free chain clears.
3.  Save merges: Detonate strong combos at choke points.
4.  Side control: Don’t strand colors on edges.
5.  Two‑ahead planning: Map the next move to preserve setups.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to swap; tap power‑ups; pause/retry in UI.
