### Detailed Game Introduction

Merge Fruit mixes gravity drops with merge‑2 rules. Drop fruits into a bin; touching identical fruits merge into a larger one. The challenge is stacking for future merges while preventing overflows at the top.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Center anchor: Keep the largest fruit near the center for multi‑side merges.
2.  Height control: Flatten spikes before they cause overflow.
3.  Chain planning: Stage twins adjacent before dropping a third to trigger cascades.
4.  Sacrifice lane: Use one edge as a trash lane for off‑cycle fruits.
5.  Patience: Don’t force drops during bounce chaos — wait a beat.

### Controls Guide

- Move left/right to aim; tap to drop; some builds allow holds/undos.
