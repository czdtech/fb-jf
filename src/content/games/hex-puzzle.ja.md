### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Hex Puzzle is a fun and engaging twist on the classic block puzzle genre, played on a hexagonal grid. The objective is to place various shapes, made of hexagonal blocks, onto the board to create complete, unbroken lines of hexes. Lines can be formed in three directions: horizontally and in both diagonal directions. When a line is complete, it clears from the board, freeing up space and earning you points. With no time limits, it’s a test of pure strategy and spatial planning.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Think in Three Directions:** Unlike a square grid, a hexagonal grid allows you to form lines in three different directions. Always be scanning the board not just for horizontal lines, but for diagonal opportunities as well.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Don't Isolate Spaces:** Try to keep your placements compact. Leaving single empty hexes scattered around the board can make it very difficult to place larger pieces later in the game.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Plan for Your Pieces:** You are given three pieces at a time. Before placing one, quickly assess if there is room for the other two. It's a common mistake to place one piece only to find that you have blocked yourself from placing the next one.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Combos are Key:** Clearing multiple lines with a single piece placement will award you a combo score bonus. Look for placements that can complete two or even three lines simultaneously for a huge score boost.
