### Detailed Game Introduction

Word Detector is a fast-paced word-finding puzzle game that challenges your vocabulary and speed. You are presented with a grid of letters and must find as many words as possible by connecting adjacent letters. Words can be formed by linking letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The goal is typically to reach a target score or find a certain number of words within a time limit to progress to the next level.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Scan for Common Prefixes and Suffixes:** Look for common letter combinations like "S", "ED", "ER", or "ING". These can often be the start or end of multiple words, helping you find several words quickly.
2.  **[ES]** **Longer Words, More Points:** While finding short three-letter words is easy, longer words are worth significantly more points. Always be on the lookout for words that are five, six, or even seven letters long.
3.  **[ES]** **Don't Forget Diagonals:** It's easy to spot horizontal and vertical words, but many players forget to look for diagonal connections. Make sure to scan the grid in all eight directions from each letter.
4.  **[ES]** **Use Hints When Stuck:** If the clock is ticking and you can't find any more words, use a hint. It can help you spot a word you overlooked and keep your momentum going.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with a simple click-and-drag motion.

*   **[ES]** **Form a Word:** Click on the first letter of the word you've found, hold the mouse button, and drag your cursor through all the adjacent letters of the word in order. Release the mouse button on the last letter to submit the word.
