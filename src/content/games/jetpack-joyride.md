### Overview
Jetpack Joyride is a high‑energy side‑scrolling runner. Hold to rise and release to fall as you dodge zappers, missiles, and lasers. Collect coins to buy gadgets and outfits, grab vehicles for temporary power (hog, dragon, mech), and complete rotating missions to earn stars and unlock upgrades.

### How to Play
- Trace safe arcs through zapper patterns; watch missile warning arrows.
- Prioritize coin lines when safe; vehicles grant hit protection.
- Equip gadget combos that suit your style (e.g., coin magnets, speed boosts).

### Controls
- Hold/tap to ascend; release to descend; buttons for gadgets/menus vary by host.

### Tips
- Learn zapper cycles; late taps thread tight gaps.
- Keep a vehicle as a safety buffer on high‑speed sections.
- Missions guide efficient progress—choose ones you can multi‑task.

### FAQ
- Q: How can I survive longer runs consistently?  
  A: Read hazard cycles, keep a vehicle as buffer, and avoid greedy coin grabs.
- Q: Which gadgets should I equip first?  
  A: Coin attraction and missile‑warning helpers are strong starters.
- Q: Do vehicles make me invincible?  
  A: They absorb a hit and then break; you still need to dodge.
