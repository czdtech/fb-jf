### Detailed Game Introduction

Mini Golf World is a crisp mini‑golf collection with ramps, windmills, and trick rails. Good scores come from precise pace control, smart bank lines, and patient timing on moving hazards.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Cup‑rim pace: Under‑hit near the hole to avoid lip‑outs.
2.  Bank lines: Use ~45° rails to redirect into corners consistently.
3.  Hazard cycles: Watch one full cycle before hitting through moving parts.
4.  Two‑putt logic: Set up a tap‑in instead of risking a wild hole‑in‑one.
5.  Camera scouting: Pan/zoom to pre‑read slopes and hidden rails.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:mini-golf-world:why-do-i-rim-out-502ee3af -->
  Q: Why do I rim out?

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:mini-golf-world:any-universal-bank-tip-5b260f7a -->
  Q: Any universal bank tip?
