### Overview
Single‑tap arcade challenge: each flap lifts the bird; release to descend. Passing a pipe pair earns one point.

### How to Play
- Keep a steady rhythm of short taps; adjust quickly after each gap.
- Avoid tapping near the top lip; give space for recovery.
- Focus on the next gap, not the current one.

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch/Space: tap to flap.

### Tips
- Use tiny taps for micro‑corrections; big taps only for emergencies.
- Don’t chase lost runs—reset if your rhythm breaks.
- Disable distractions; latency affects timing.

### FAQ
- Q: Why does the bird hit the top after a flap?  
  A: Taps are too strong or too frequent; use lighter, spaced taps.
- Q: Is there an end to the game?  
  A: No, it is an endless score chase.
- Q: Does the speed change over time?  
  A: Most versions keep constant speed and difficulty.
