### Detailed Game Introduction

House Flip is a light renovation sim. Evaluate a property’s issues (layout flow, damaged fixtures, dated style), choose upgrades within a budget, and resell for profit. Efficient flips balance cost vs. value — kitchens/baths, paint, and curb appeal punch above their weight.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** ROI triage: Prioritize kitchens/baths, flooring, and paint; defer low‑impact rooms.
2.  **[KO]** Layout fixes: Remove bottlenecks, add storage, and ensure good flow.
3.  **[KO]** Theming: Keep a cohesive palette; mismatched rooms reduce appeal.
4.  **[KO]** Staging: Add a few decor items to lift perceived value.
5.  **[KO]** Budget control: Leave a contingency; don’t over‑invest beyond neighborhood caps.

### Controls Guide

- Inspect rooms, pick upgrades, place items, and confirm; some builds time‑gate tasks.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

A: Focus on high‑ROI upgrades and avoid over‑customization; keep budgets lean.

- Q: Which upgrade first?

A: Kitchen (surfaces/appliances) or bathrooms (fixtures/tiles) depending on condition.
