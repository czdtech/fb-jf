### Detailed Game Introduction

Color Roll 3D presents layered strips you unroll to cover a board exactly. The trick is sequencing: later strips may cover earlier ones, so you must choose an order that matches the target image without overlap errors.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with the deepest/base color that covers the largest area.
2.  Place boundary strips to frame shapes, then fill interiors.
3.  Watch overlaps — avoid burying needed edges under later strips.
4.  Undo early when the final gaps look impossible.
5.  Compare with the target preview after each placement.
