### Detailed Game Introduction

Ultimate Knife Smash is a timing‑based arcade game. Throw knives into a spinning target without striking existing blades. The rotation speed and direction often change, demanding clean timing, rhythm, and risk control for combo stages.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Watch rotations: Note speed shifts and direction flips before committing throws.
2.  Count beats: Use a consistent cadence; throw on the same slice of the rotation.
3.  Aim gaps: Target wide openings first; save tight gaps for slow rotations.
4.  Don’t rush: Missing a cycle is better than forcing a risky throw.
5.  Boss targets: Later stages may require extra hits—pace your throws.

### Controls Guide

- Pause/Retry: Use UI controls to restart.
