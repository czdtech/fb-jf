### Game Introduction

Klondike Solitaire is the most popular and well-known version of the single-player card game, often referred to simply as "Solitaire." Using a standard 52-card deck, the goal is to organize all the cards into four foundation piles, one for each suit, in ascending order. It's a game of patience, strategy, and a little bit of luck.

### Gameplay Guide

The main objective is to build four foundation piles, starting with the Ace and ending with the King for each suit (e.g., A♣, 2♣, 3♣...).
- **Tableau:** You can move cards within the main playing area (the tableau) by stacking them in descending order (K, Q, J...) and alternating colors (e.g., a red 7 on a black 8).
- **Revealing Cards:** When you move a face-up card, you can flip the face-down card beneath it.
- **Stock Pile:** Draw cards from the stock pile to bring new cards into play via the waste pile.
- **Empty Columns:** Only a King can be moved into an empty tableau column.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse/Touch:** Click and drag cards to move them between piles. In most versions, you can also simply click a card, and it will automatically move to a valid position if one is available.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is the difference between Klondike and other types of Solitaire?**

Klondike is the version most people know, characterized by its seven-column tableau and the goal of building up from Ace to King. Other versions like Spider or FreeCell have different rules and layouts.

**What does "Klondike" mean?**

The name is believed to have originated from the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada, possibly because the game was popular among prospectors.

**Is every game of Klondike Solitaire winnable?**

No, not every deal is winnable. The random shuffle of the cards means that some games are mathematically impossible to solve, which is part of the challenge.
