### Detailed Game Introduction

Addiction Mini is a compact take on the Addiction/Monte Carlo family of patience games. Slide or place cards into increasing sequences by suit or color per mode rules, opening spaces and resolving deadlocks with careful planning.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Open spaces: Create empty slots early to enable rearrangement.
2.  Build from anchors: Start sequences at the lowest legal values and extend cleanly.
3.  Avoid blocking keys: Don’t trap needed cards behind immovable structures.
4.  Save swaps: Limited reshuffles/swaps should resolve multiple issues at once.
5.  Think ahead: Visualize two to three placements in advance.

### Controls Guide

- Drag or click to move cards per rules; use available swaps.
- Undo/Reset if provided.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- No moves left—what now? Use a swap/shuffle if available or restart.
- Strict rules? Variants differ; read each mode’s constraints.
- Is it winnable? Many deals are solvable with accurate planning.
