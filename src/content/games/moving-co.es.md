### Detailed Game Introduction

Moving Co. is a light logistics and packing challenge. Navigate rooms, pick up furniture or boxes, and move them to the truck or target spots while avoiding collisions and minimizing trips. Tight doorways, fragile items, and awkward shapes create spatial puzzles under time pressure.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** Survey first: Identify large items and narrow passages; move big pieces before clutter blocks routes.
2.  **[ES]** Stack smart: Place heavy items first to stabilize loads; avoid stacking fragile pieces underneath.
3.  **[ES]** Shortest loops: Plan compact loops that grab multiple items per trip when possible.
4.  **[ES]** Turn radius: Rotate early through doors; wide turns reduce bumps and time losses.
5.  **[ES]** Handle fragile: Slow down near obstacles; a clean run beats a risky crash‑and‑restart.

### Controls Guide

- Move: Arrow keys / WASD; some versions support drag joystick.
- Pick/Drop: Context action on contact or a dedicated button.
- Rotate (if available): Use on‑screen arrows or Q/E.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Items keep getting stuck—what to do? Clear small clutter first or rotate earlier before doorways.
- Do I lose score for bumps? Many modes penalize collisions or breaking fragile items; smooth movement pays off.
- How to 3‑star? Fewer trips, early big‑item moves, and tidy stacking.
