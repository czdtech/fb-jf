### Detailed Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning* is a surreal survival horror game that masquerades as a low-budget 90s educational game. The player takes on the role of a student at Baldi's schoolhouse, with the initial objective of finding seven notebooks scattered throughout the classrooms to help a friend.

コントロール are standard for first-person PC games.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game starts innocently enough. The first notebook contains simple arithmetic problems. However, the game's true nature is revealed upon finding the second notebook, where the third question is a jumbled, unsolvable mess of numbers. Answering this question incorrectly—which is unavoidable—enrages the titular character, Baldi. Armed with a ruler, Baldi begins to hunt the player through the halls of the school. From this point on, the game becomes a tense cat-and-mouse chase. The primary goal shifts from education to survival: collect the remaining five notebooks while evading Baldi and a cast of other bizarre characters, each with their own unique way of impeding your progress, and ultimately find a way to escape the school.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Success in *Baldi's Basics* relies on sound awareness, resource management, and understanding the behavior of each character.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Sound is Your Most Important Tool:** Baldi's primary method of locating you is sound. He is drawn to the sound of opening and closing doors. More importantly, you can track his proximity by listening to the sound of his ruler slapping against his hand. The louder and more frequent the slap, the closer he is. Use this to your advantage to know when to hide or run.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Stamina Management is Key:** You have a limited stamina bar for running (activated with the Shift key). Do not waste it. Only run when Baldi is very close or when you need to quickly cross an open area. The Principal will also put you in detention for running in the halls, so be mindful of his location.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Learn the Characters and How to Counter Them:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Baldi:** He gets faster with every notebook you collect. Keep your distance and use sound to misdirect him if possible.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Playtime:** A little girl with a jump rope who will force you to play with her, stopping you in your tracks. The only way to escape quickly is by using the **Safety Scissors** to cut her rope. Always try to have scissors on hand.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Principal of the Thing:** He roams the halls and will send you to detention (a 15-30 second timeout) for breaking school rules (running, entering faculty rooms, using BSoda in the halls). Avoid him when you need to run.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **It's a Bully:** Blocks hallways and demands an item. You must give him something from your inventory to pass. It's often best to find an alternate route.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Gotta Sweep:** A giant broom that periodically sweeps through the halls, pushing all characters (including you and Baldi) in its path. It can be a lifesaver or a death sentence depending on the situation.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **1st Prize:** A slow-moving robot that will hug you and push you down a hallway. He can be annoying, but sometimes he can push you away from Baldi. You can use the scissors on his wiring to disable him temporarily.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Item Strategy:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **BSoda:** A can of soda that can be used to push characters away. Excellent for creating distance from Baldi or getting past the Bully without losing a more valuable item.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Energy Flavored Zesty Bar:** Fully restores your stamina. Invaluable for making a long run.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Safety Scissors:** Your counter to Playtime and 1st Prize. A top-priority item.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Quarter:** Can be used in vending machines to get a BSoda or on the payphone in the Principal's office to briefly distract Baldi.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **The Final Escape:** After collecting all seven notebooks, the school will turn red, an alarm will blare, and Baldi will move at his maximum speed. You must find three exits, which will initially be blocked. After touching all three fake exits, the fourth and final exit will open, allowing you to escape. This final phase is a pure test of speed, item usage, and luck.
