### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bloons TD 2 is the second installment in the classic tower defense series. The game builds upon the foundation of the original by introducing the key feature of **tower upgrades**. The objective remains the same: use monkeys to pop waves of advancing balloons ("Bloons") before they reach the end of the track and cost you lives.
- **Balanced Defense is Essential:** This is the most critical strategy in Bloons TD 2. Because Black Bloons are immune to bombs and White Bloons are immune to ice, you cannot rely on just one type of damage. Your defense must include towers that can handle both (like Dart Monkeys, Tack 撃つers, and Super Monkeys) alongside your specialized towers.
    - **Rainbow Bloons:** The toughest Bloon in the game. When popped, it releases two Zebra Bloons.（日本語訳が必要）
