### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] TNT Bomb is a strategic, physics-based puzzle game where your objective is demolition. In each level, you are presented with a structure and a limited inventory of explosives. Your task is to carefully place your bombs on the structure in a way that will cause the most damage. By identifying key support points and using the right bomb for the job, you must try to obliterate the entire structure to move on to the next challenge.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Analyze the Structure:** Before placing any bombs, examine the structure's design. Look for weak points, key support beams, and load-bearing blocks at the base.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Target the Foundation:** The most effective strategy is almost always to destroy the foundation. Placing your most powerful explosives on the lowest support blocks will destabilize the entire structure, causing it to collapse under its own weight.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Know Your Explosives:** You will have different types of bombs. A standard TNT stick might be good for a single block, while a larger C4 bomb will have a much bigger blast radius. Use the right tool for the right job.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Chain Reactions:** Think about how the explosion will travel. Placing a bomb that causes one part of the structure to fall onto another can create a chain reaction, leading to more destruction than the bomb could achieve on its own.
