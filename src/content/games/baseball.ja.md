### Detailed Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Doodle Baseball* is a charming and deceptively simple arcade-style baseball game. Presented with a unique hand-drawn "doodle" aesthetic, the player takes on the role of a batter from a team of various food items, facing off against an opposing team of anthropomorphic peanuts.
The controls are as simple as possible, making the game accessible to everyone.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The objective of the game is straightforward: hit the ball thrown by the pitcher and score as many runs as possible. The gameplay loop is focused entirely on the act of batting. The player does not control fielding or base running; these actions are automated based on the quality of the hit. The challenge comes from the variety of pitches thrown by the opposing team. As the game progresses, pitchers will throw balls at different speeds and trajectories, including fastballs, curveballs, and slow pitches, requiring the player to adapt their timing with each swing. The game ends after the player gets three strikes, and the goal is to achieve the highest possible score.

### Gameplay Strategy
**1. How do I hit a home run?**（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] While the game uses only one button, mastering it requires focus and timing.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Watch the Pitcher's Wind-up:** The pitcher's animation is your first clue. Pay attention to their wind-up motion, as it can sometimes signal the type of pitch that is coming.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Focus on the Ball, Not the Bat:** Your eyes should track the baseball from the moment it leaves the pitcher's hand until it reaches the plate. This is the most effective way to judge its speed and trajectory.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Learn to Differentiate Pitch Speeds:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Fastball:** This is a straight, fast pitch. It requires a quick reaction. Be ready to swing almost as soon as you identify it.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Slow Pitch/Curveball:** These are designed to fool you into swinging too early. The ball will float towards the plate much slower than a fastball. You must be patient and wait an extra moment before swinging. This is the most common reason for getting a strike.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Timing is Everything:** The quality of your hit is determined by *when* you swing.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Home Run:** Hitting the ball perfectly in the "sweet spot" as it crosses the plate will usually result in a home run.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Single/Double:** Hitting the ball slightly early or late will result in a base hit.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Foul Ball/Strike:** Swinging too early or too late will result in a miss.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Don't Be Afraid to Take a Strike:** While every pitch in the game is typically a strike, the mental exercise of waiting helps you calibrate your timing for the slower pitches. Rushing your swing is the fastest way to get three outs.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. How do I hit a home run?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] A home run is achieved through perfect timing. You need to swing and make contact with the ball at the ideal moment, just as it crosses the home plate.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. Is it possible to win the game?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Doodle Baseball* is an endless arcade game. There is no final inning or opponent to "beat." The goal is not to win, but to score as many runs as you can before getting three outs and setting a new personal high score.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. Why do I keep striking out on slow pitches?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] This is the game's primary challenge. Your brain gets used to the timing of fastballs, so when a slow pitch comes, your instinct is to swing at the same speed. You must consciously force yourself to wait longer than you think you need to before swinging at a slow ball.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. Can I choose my character or team?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] No, the player characters (batters) cycle automatically as you play. They are all part of the same team and have no gameplay differences.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **5. Does the game get harder?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Yes. As you score more runs, the opposing pitchers will begin to use a wider variety of pitches, including faster fastballs and trickier curveballs, making it more challenging to time your swings correctly.
