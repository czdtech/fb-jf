### Detailed Game Introduction

Pick a Lock is a minimalist rhythm‑timing game: a dial sweeps around a lock, and you must tap exactly when it passes highlighted markers. Later locks add multiple markers, tighter windows, and reversed sweeps, rewarding calm focus.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Count rhythm: Lock into the dial’s beat; tap on the beat rather than by eye alone.
2.  Peripheral vision: Watch the next marker while tapping the current.
3.  Noise control: Mute distractions and keep a steady posture for precision.
4.  Recovery: If you miss, reset your cadence before the next marker.
5.  Late‑tap bias: Slightly late taps are safer than early in many builds.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/click when the dial overlaps markers; some variants support key presses.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:pick-a-lock:im-always-early-fix-fb245eab -->
  Q: I’m always early — fix?
  
  A: Add a tiny delay to your internal count; try “one‑and‑tap” instead of “one‑tap.”

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:pick-a-lock:markers-stack-fast-7f2aa7b7 -->
  Q: Markers stack fast.
  
  A: Focus on the next one only; don’t mentally hold more than one future target.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:pick-a-lock:does-fps-matter-c4d00307 -->
  Q: Does FPS matter?
  
  A: Stable framerate helps; close other apps if timing feels inconsistent.
