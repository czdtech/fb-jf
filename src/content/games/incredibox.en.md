### Incredibox Introduction

Want to build your own track with a crew of quirky beatboxers? Incredibox is part music game, part creation tool: you drag sound icons onto characters to stack beats, melodies, effects, and voices into a looping mix.

It’s easy to pick up and fun to explore. Try different combinations, listen for how layers fit together, and tweak the groove until it feels right—then save or share your mix (depending on the host).

### Incredibox Versions
 
While the core gameplay remains the same, each Incredibox version has its own unique characters, sounds, and themes. Here's a rundown of the most popular versions:
 
 - **V1 Alpha:** The beginning of it all! Classic beatboxing style with jazz and funk influences. You can hear scratches, human beatboxing, and deep basslines.
 - **V2 Little Miss:** The style is cuter and the style is more relaxed! The characters are cute, and the sounds are mainly a cappella and beatboxing, focusing on vocal elements such as whistles, tongue trills, and scat singing.
 - **V3 Sunrise:** Ready for a tropical trip? V3 has a bright and cheerful atmosphere, with steel drums, marimbas, and xylophones, making your works full of summer island style.
 - **V4 The Love:** As you can see, V4 focuses on romantic themes. Soulful vocals, acoustic guitars, and smooth saxophones are the perfect choices for creating love songs and moving ballads.
 - **V5 Brazil:** V5 ignites your passion with vibrant Brazilian music! Explosive rhythms and rich percussion instruments (such as cuicas, pandeiros, and berimbaus) allow you to be instantly immersed in the sea of samba.
 - **V6 Alive:** V6 takes you into nature! Flutes, didgeridoos, handpans and other instruments blend perfectly with natural sound effects such as bird chirping and flowing water, creating a peaceful and natural soundscape.
 - **V7 Jeevan:** Take a musical journey to India! V7 incorporates traditional Indian instruments such as the sitar and tabla, making your music full of exotic charm.
 - **V8 Dystopia:** Ready to welcome dark and industrial sounds? V8 has heavy bass, distorted guitars, and electronic synthesizers, which are most suitable for creating dark and avant-garde beats.
 - **V9 Wekiddy:** Let yourself go and have fun! V9 uses a cartoon theme and various quirky sound effects (such as laser beams, robots, and funny vocals) to let you create interesting and nonsensical beats.
 - **Orin Ayo:** This special version is launched by Incredibox in cooperation with the MIT Scratch programming platform. You can learn programming knowledge while enjoying the fun of music creation!

### Incredibox Tips
 
 - **Experiment boldly:** Try different combinations—some mixes even unlock fun animations and bonuses.
 - **Listen for balance:** If the mix feels crowded, remove one layer and rebuild.
 - **Start simple:** Build a beat first, then add melody and effects little by little.
 - **Use repetition on purpose:** Repeating a hook can make your track feel catchy and intentional.
 - **Share:** Once you’re happy with the result, save or share it with friends (options vary by host).
 
 
### Conclusion
 
With its intuitive drag-and-drop flow and endless combinations, Incredibox is a playful way to explore rhythm and arrangement. Pick a version, build a loop, and keep tweaking until it sounds like you.
