### Detailed Game Introduction

Cake Slice Ninja channels classic slice‑’em‑up action: flick to slice cakes as they fly, build combo chains with fast successive cuts, and dodge bombs or penalties that break your streak.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Long straight swipes: Slice multiple pieces in a single motion to bank combos.
2.  Don’t chase low cuts: Let low pieces rise into a safer arc before slicing.
3.  Bomb discipline: When bombs appear, prioritize clean misses over risky slices.
4.  Read spawns: Memorize spawn rhythms to pre‑position your cursor.
5.  Recover quickly: If a combo drops, reset posture and rebuild with safe doubles.

### Controls Guide

- Slice: Click‑drag or swipe to cut through targets.
- Pause/Retry: Use on‑screen buttons.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Missed a piece—big penalty? Modes vary; many dock combo or time, not full score.
- Any two‑finger tricks? On touch devices, multi‑finger swipes can cover more area if supported.
- How to avoid bombs? Track their fuses and paths; never complete a swipe that crosses a bomb.
