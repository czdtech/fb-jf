### Detailed Game Introduction

Cake Slice Ninja channels classic slice‑’em‑up action: flick to slice cakes as they fly, build combo chains with fast successive cuts, and dodge bombs or penalties that break your streak.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Long straight swipes: Slice multiple pieces in a single motion to bank combos.
2.  Don’t chase low cuts: Let low pieces rise into a safer arc before slicing.
3.  Bomb discipline: When bombs appear, prioritize clean misses over risky slices.
4.  Read spawns: Memorize spawn rhythms to pre‑position your cursor.
5.  Recover quickly: If a combo drops, reset posture and rebuild with safe doubles.
