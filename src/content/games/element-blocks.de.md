### Detailed Game Introduction

Element Blocks is a calm yet strategic puzzle game that builds on the popular 10x10 block puzzle formula. Players place various Tetris-like shapes, themed as elemental blocks, onto a 10x10 grid. The goal is to fill and clear complete lines either horizontally or vertically. What sets this game apart is the addition of a star collection and power-up system, providing a strategic tool to get you out of difficult situations and extend your game.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Standard 10x10 Rules:** You are given three block shapes at a time. You must place all three on the board before a new set appears. The blocks cannot be rotated.
2.  **[DE]** **Collect Stars:** Occasionally, blocks will appear with stars embedded in them. When you clear a line that includes one of these special blocks, you collect the star. These stars are the currency for using power-ups.
3.  **[DE]** **Use Power-ups Wisely:** Collected stars can be spent on powerful boosters. These might include a bomb to clear a small area, a lightning bolt to destroy a single line, or other helpful tools. Save these for when you are truly stuck and have no other good moves.
4.  **[DE]** **Think About Future Shapes:** Don't just place a block where it fits now. Look at the other two shapes you have and try to place the current one in a way that leaves room for the others. The game ends when you can't place any of the three given shapes.
5.  **[DE]** **Maximize Combos:** Clearing multiple lines with a single block placement is called a combo and will grant you a significant score bonus. Always be on the lookout for combo opportunities.

### Controls Guide

*   **[DE]** **Place Blocks:** Use your mouse or finger to drag a block from the holding area at the bottom and drop it onto the main grid.
*   **[DE]** **Use Power-ups:** Click on a power-up icon once you have enough stars, then click on the grid where you want to apply its effect.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: How do I get stars?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** You collect stars by clearing a line that contains one or more blocks with stars on them.

*   **[DE]** **Q: Can I rotate the blocks?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** No, the inability to rotate the blocks is a core part of the challenge. You must plan your placements based on the shapes as they are given.

*   **[DE]** **Q: What is the best way to use my stars?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** It's best to save your stars for emergency situations. When your board is getting dangerously full and you can't fit one of the upcoming pieces, using a power-up to clear a specific area can save your game and allow you to continue playing for a much higher score.
