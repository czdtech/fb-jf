### Detailed Game Introduction

2048 Fusion is a sleek and modern version of the classic 2048 sliding block puzzle. The game is played on a 4x4 grid where you must slide and combine numbered tiles. When two tiles with the same number touch, they merge into a single tile with their values added together. The primary objective is to create the elusive "2048" tile, but the game can continue beyond that for an even higher score. It's a game of foresight, strategy, and a little bit of luck.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Corner Strategy:** This is the most popular and effective strategy. Choose one corner of the grid (e.g., the top right) and make it your goal to always keep your highest-value tile in that spot. This provides a stable anchor to build towards.
2.  **Limit Your Movements:** To keep your highest tile in its corner, avoid swiping in the direction that would move it. For example, if your highest tile is in the top-right corner, you should primarily use the Up and Right arrow keys, and only use Left or Down when absolutely necessary. This keeps the board organized.
3.  **Build Chains:** Arrange your tiles in descending order leading away from your high-value corner. For example, if your 512 tile is in the corner, try to have the 256, 128, and 64 tiles in a line next to it. This makes it much easier to perform chain merges.
4.  **Don't Chase Small Merges:** Avoid making small, isolated merges in the middle of the board. This can disrupt your structure and create tiles that are difficult to get rid of.

### Controls Guide

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
    *   **A:** The main goal is to combine tiles until you create the 2048 tile. After that, you can continue playing to see how high you can score.

*   **Q: How do I lose?**
    *   **A:** The game ends when the grid is completely full of tiles and there are no possible moves left (i.e., no adjacent tiles have the same number).

*   **Q: Where does the new tile appear?**
    *   **A:** After every move, a new tile (either a 2 or a 4) will appear in a random empty spot on the grid.
