### Detailed Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Battleship* is a classic two-player strategy guessing game. The objective is to be the first to sink all of your opponent's warships. The game is played on two grids for each player: one grid represents your own ocean, where you secretly place your fleet of ships, and the other represents your opponent's ocean, which you use to track your guesses.

    - **Game Feedback:** The game will automatically mark the square as a hit (usually with a red marker or explosion) or a miss (with a white marker or splash icon).（日本語訳が必要）
    - **Place a Ship:** 移動する your mouse over your grid to the desired location and click to place it.
    - **Rotate a Ship:** Often there is a dedicated button to rotate the ship from horizontal to vertical, or you can use the right mouse button.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Before the battle begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their own grid. A standard fleet consists of five ships of varying lengths, which must be placed either horizontally or vertically, and cannot overlap:

### Frequently Asked questions (よくある質問)
*   **Aircraft Carrier** (5 squares)
    - **Fire a Shot:** Click on a square on the opponent's grid to fire at that coordinate.（日本語訳が必要）
    - **Select a Ship:** Click on a ship from your fleet.（日本語訳が必要）
    - **Rotate a Ship:** Often there is a dedicated button to rotate the ship from horizontal to vertical, or you can use the right mouse button.（日本語訳が必要）
*   **Battleship** (4 squares)
    - **Fire a Shot:** Click on a square on the opponent's grid to fire at that coordinate.（日本語訳が必要）
*   **Cruiser** (3 squares)
*   **Submarine** (3 squares)
*   **Destroyer** (2 squares)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Once both players have placed their fleets, they take turns firing "shots" at the opponent's grid by calling out a coordinate (e.g., "D5"). The opponent must respond with either "Hit!" if a ship occupies that square, or "Miss!" if it's empty water. Players mark their opponent's grid with pegs or icons to record hits and misses, using this information to deduce the location of the enemy ships. A ship is considered "sunk" when all of its squares have been hit.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Winning at *Battleship* involves a combination of clever placement and logical deduction.

#### Ship Placement Strategy (Defense):

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Avoid the Obvious:** Many players tend to place ships along the edges or in the corners of the grid. Avoid these common spots to make your ships harder to find.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Don't Cluster:** Placing all your ships close together is risky. Once your opponent finds one ship, they will easily find the others nearby. Spread your fleet across the entire grid.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Don't Let Ships Touch:** If possible, place ships so that they are not adjacent to each other. This prevents an opponent from getting a hit on one ship and immediately finding another right next to it.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Embrace the Center:** Placing some ships, especially smaller ones, in the middle of the board can be effective, as many opponents focus their initial search patterns on the outer areas.

#### Firing Strategy (Offense):

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Use a Search Pattern:** Do not fire randomly. The most effective strategy is to use a pattern that covers the board efficiently. A "checkerboard" or "parity" pattern is highly recommended. This means firing on every other square (e.g., A1, A3, A5, B2, B4, C1, C3, etc.). This guarantees you will find any ship on the board in fewer moves, as no ship can hide between the squares of your grid pattern.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Switch to "Hunt" Mode:** As soon as you get a "Hit," stop your search pattern. Now your goal is to determine the ship's orientation. Fire at the adjacent squares (above, below, left, and right) of the initial hit.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Sink the Ship:** Once you get a second consecutive hit, you know the ship's orientation (horizontal or vertical). Continue firing along that line until you get a "miss." This means you have found the end of the ship. Then, work your way down the other end until the ship is sunk.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Use Logic:** Keep track of which ships have been sunk. If you've already sunk the 2-square Destroyer, you know that any single hit in an open area must be part of a larger ship. This helps you eliminate possibilities and make smarter guesses.

### Controls Guide

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] For digital versions of *Battleship*, the controls are typically mouse-driven and very intuitive.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Select a Ship:** Click on a ship from your fleet.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Place a Ship:** Move your mouse over your grid to the desired location and click to place it.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Rotate a Ship:** Often there is a dedicated button to rotate the ship from horizontal to vertical, or you can use the right mouse button.

### Frequently Asked questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. What are the standard ships in a game of Battleship?**

- **Placement Phase:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The standard fleet includes an Aircraft Carrier (5 squares), a Battleship (4 squares), a Cruiser (3 squares), a Submarine (3 squares), and a Destroyer (2 squares).

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. Can I place ships diagonally?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] No. In the standard rules of *Battleship*, ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. Is it better to place my ships touching each other or separated?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] It is almost always better to place your ships so they are not touching. Spreading them out forces your opponent to start a new search pattern after sinking each ship, wasting their turns.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. Is the game just pure luck?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] No. While there is an element of luck in the initial search, the game heavily relies on strategy, logic, and deduction. A player with a good search pattern and logical thinking will consistently beat a player who guesses randomly.
