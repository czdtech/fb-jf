### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on an 8x8 grid called a chessboard. Each player begins with 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two knights, two bishops, and eight pawns. The objective of the game is to **checkmate** the opponent's king. A checkmate happens when the king is in a position to be captured (in "check") and there is no legal move to escape the capture.
2.  **Pawn Promotion:** The goal of the endgame is often to advance one of your pawns to the other end of the board to promote it to a queen. A "passed pawn" (a pawn with no enemy pawns in front of it) is a major advantage.（日本語訳が必要）

### Gameplay Strategy

#### Opening Principles
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Control the Center:** The central squares (d4, e4, d5, e5) are the most important. Pieces in the center control more of the board and have greater mobility.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Develop Your Pieces:** Move your knights and bishops out from their starting squares to active positions. A good rule of thumb is to move knights before bishops.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Castle Early:** Castling is a special move that gets your king to safety and develops one of your rooks. It's a crucial part of the opening.

#### Mid-Game Strategy
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Piece Value:** Understand the relative value of your pieces as a general guide (Pawn=1, Knight=3, Bishop=3, Rook=5, Queen=9). Avoid losing a more valuable piece for a less valuable one unless it leads to a clear advantage.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Fork:** A single piece attacking two or more enemy pieces at once.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Pin:** An attack on a piece that cannot move without exposing a more valuable piece behind it.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Skewer:** An attack on a valuable piece that, when it moves, exposes a less valuable piece behind it to capture.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Always Think About Your Opponent's Move:** After your opponent moves, ask yourself: "What is their plan? What are they threatening?"
