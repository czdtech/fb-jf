### Detailed Game Introduction

FullSpeed Racing delivers approachable circuit racing. Learn track layouts, brake in straight lines, apex smoothly, and accelerate early without wheelspin. Clean overtakes and consistency win more races than raw top speed.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Brake early: Enter slower, exit faster; avoid mid‑corner braking.
2.  Late apex: Turn slightly later to straighten exits and open throttle sooner.
3.  Defend fair: Hold a single defensive line; avoid weaving.
4.  Watch minimap: Anticipate traffic and blue‑flag faster cars.
5.  Consistency: String clean laps; mistakes cost more than cautious corners.

### Controls Guide

- Steer: A/D or Left/Right.
- Throttle/Brake: W/S or Up/Down.
