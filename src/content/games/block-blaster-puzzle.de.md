### Detailed Game Introduction

Block Blaster Puzzle is a clean, session‑friendly block‑placement game. You’re given sets of pieces to fit onto a grid; completing rows or regions clears space. Success relies on shaping the board to accept awkward pieces later, staging multi‑line clears, and avoiding sealed cavities that cannot be filled.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Edge hygiene: Keep borders smooth to reduce isolated single cells.
2.  **[DE]** Reserve sockets: Leave a few 2×2 or 3‑cell pockets for common awkward pieces.
3.  **[DE]** Multi‑line setups: Build toward double/triple clears to refresh space quickly.
4.  **[DE]** Avoid tall wells: Don’t dig narrow vertical shafts you can’t fill later.
5.  **[DE]** Piece triage: Place the hardest piece first when the board gets crowded.
6.  **[DE]** Use previews: If next pieces are visible, plan sequences instead of single moves.

### Controls Guide

- Drag shapes onto the grid; rotate if supported by tapping or a rotate button.
- Undo/Reset are helpful for greedy placements gone wrong.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I always run out of space—how can I last longer?

A: Focus on multi‑line clears and keep a couple of flexible pockets open. Place your hardest piece first when the grid is tight.

- Q: Should I keep the board center open or fill edges first?

A: Keep the center breathable and tidy edges gradually; the center gives the most flexibility for odd shapes.

- Q: Rotations feel limited—any workaround?

A: Not all variants allow rotation. Prioritize symmetric placements and leave pockets to accommodate rigid pieces.

- Q: Are there levels or endless score chase?

A: Many builds are endless; some offer level goals. Either way, board management is the key skill.

- Q: When should I use undo?

A: Undo early when you notice a placement creates sealed cavities or removes your last flexible pocket.
