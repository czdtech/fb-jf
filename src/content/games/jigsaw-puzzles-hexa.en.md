### Detailed Game Introduction

Jigsaw Puzzles Hexa offers a refreshing and modern take on the timeless jigsaw puzzle. Instead of traditional, uniquely shaped interlocking pieces, this game uses clusters of hexagonal blocks. Your goal is to drag these hexa shapes from your inventory and place them correctly onto the main board to complete a beautiful, high-definition picture. With no time limits, it provides a relaxing yet mentally stimulating experience that challenges your spatial reasoning.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Analyze the Shapes:** Before you start placing pieces, take a look at the shapes you are given. Unlike a normal jigsaw, you are working with geometric block clusters. Mentally picture how they might fit together on the board.
2.  **Start with Unique Outlines:** Look for distinctive parts of the puzzle outline. If there is a long, straight edge or a unique corner, find the piece in your inventory that would fit that specific shape. This helps to anchor your puzzle.
3.  **Work by Section:** Don't try to place pieces all over the board at once. Focus on completing one area, like a corner or a specific object in the picture. Completing one section often makes it much easier to see where the remaining pieces go.
4.  **Trial and Error:** Since the pieces don't have unique picture snippets like a normal jigsaw, you will often need to use trial and error. If a piece doesn't fit, simply drag it back to your inventory and try a different one.
