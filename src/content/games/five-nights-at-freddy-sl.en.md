<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Story‑driven entry with nightly objectives. You crawl through vents, repair systems, and follow instructions while avoiding Funtime animatronics.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Follow the terminal’s prompts, but adapt when instructions fail.
- Use audio, shock, and monitoring only when required; conserve actions.
- Later nights remix tasks with higher risk and tighter windows.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Mouse/UI to interact with panels, shocks, and monitors; movement keys for vent sections (host dependent).

### Tips
- Listen carefully—audio cues and flickers telegraph danger.
- Move slowly through dark vent segments; rushing triggers failures.
- Rehearse panel sequences so you can execute under pressure.
