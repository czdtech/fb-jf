### Detailed Game Introduction

Garden Bloom is a relaxing and creative game that beautifully blends classic match-3 puzzles with garden design and restoration. Players are tasked with transforming a neglected garden back to its former glory. The core of the game involves completing match-3 levels, where you swap colorful flowers and other garden elements to achieve specific goals. Successfully beating a level rewards you with stars, which act as the currency to perform tasks in the garden, such as cleaning up, planting flowers, and placing beautiful decorations.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **The Two-Part Gameplay:**
    *   **[ES]** **Match-3 Puzzles:** This is where you earn your stars. Each level has a unique objective (e.g., collect 30 red flowers, clear all the dirt patches) that must be completed in a limited number of moves.
    *   **[ES]** **Garden Restoration:** Use the stars you've earned to complete tasks from your to-do list. This involves making design choices and progressively unlocking new areas of the garden.

2.  **[ES]** **Match-3 Strategy:**
    *   **[ES]** **Focus on the Objective:** Don't just make random matches. Always prioritize matches that directly help you achieve the level's goal.
    *   **[ES]** **Create Power-ups:** Matching more than three items creates powerful boosters. A 4-in-a-row match might create a bee that clears a line, while an L-shape match could create a bomb. Combining these boosters leads to even bigger board-clearing effects.
    *   **[ES]** **Plan Your Moves:** Think a step or two ahead. Look for opportunities to set up cascades or special gem combinations. Since moves are limited, every swap counts.

3.  **[ES]** **Garden Design:**
    *   **[ES]** As you complete tasks, you will often be given a choice between three different styles for a decoration (e.g., three different types of benches). Choose the one that best fits your vision for the garden!

### Controls Guide

*   **[ES]** **In the Puzzle:** Use your mouse or finger to swap two adjacent items (like flowers or leaves). Click and drag one item onto the next, or click them one by one.
*   **[ES]** **In the Garden:** Click on the task list (usually on the bottom left) to see what needs to be done. Click on a task to spend a star and complete it.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[ES]** **Q: How do I earn stars?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** You can only earn stars by successfully completing the match-3 puzzle levels. Each level you beat will typically award you one star.

*   **[ES]** **Q: What happens if I run out of moves in a puzzle?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** If you fail to complete the objective within the move limit, you will lose a life. You can either wait for your lives to regenerate over time or use in-game coins to get extra moves or a refill.

*   **[ES]** **Q: Can I change the decorations I've chosen for the garden?**
    *   **[ES]** **A:** In most games of this genre, once you have made a design choice, it is permanent. To change it, you usually have to press and hold the placed object and spend some coins.
