### Detailed Game Introduction

Endless Lake is a minimalist and challenging endless runner that tests your timing and reflexes. You control a character running across a series of platforms suspended over a tranquil lake. The gameplay is focused on one simple mechanic: jumping. You must perfectly time your single and double jumps to navigate the ever-changing gaps between platforms and see how far you can go.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Master the Double Jump:** The most crucial skill in the game is the double jump. Tapping once gives you a short hop, but tapping a second time while in mid-air gives you an extra boost to cross wider gaps. Learning the feel and distance of both jump types is essential.
2.  **Find Your Rhythm:** The game has a distinct rhythm. Try to get into a flow with your jumps. As the speed increases, your reaction time will need to get shorter, but a steady rhythm can help you stay focused.
3.  **Don't Double Jump Unnecessarily:** A common mistake is to use a double jump for a short gap. This can mess up your timing and positioning for the next jump. Only use the double jump when it's absolutely necessary.
4.  **Look Ahead:** Keep your eyes focused a few platforms ahead of your character. This will give you more time to recognize whether the next gap requires a single or a double jump.
