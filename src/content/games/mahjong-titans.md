### Overview
Mahjong Titans is a tile‑matching solitaire using mahjong tiles. Only free tiles—those with no tile on top and at least one open side—can be paired and removed. The challenge is to spot pairs that open future moves and avoid deadlocks.

### How to Play
- Remove matching pairs of free tiles; seasons/flowers match across sets.
- Work from the top and outer edges inward to open space.
- Use limited undos/hints sparingly.

### Controls
- Mouse/touch select pairs; hint/undo buttons vary by host.

### Tips
- Prioritize pairs that unblock many tiles.
- Avoid pairing deep stacks too early unless it opens a key lane.
- Track duplicate tiles to prevent isolating a singleton.

### FAQ
- Q: Which tiles count as free in Mahjong Titans?  
  A: A tile with no tile on top and at least one side free (left or right).
- Q: Can seasons and flowers match with any of their kind?  
  A: Yes, any season matches any season; any flower matches any flower.
- Q: How do I avoid unwinnable states?  
  A: Keep multiple options open and avoid isolating unique tiles early.
