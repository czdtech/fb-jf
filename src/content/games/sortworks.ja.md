### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] SortWorks blends visual sorting with bin constraints (color/shape/type). Items arrive on belts; you must route them to correct bins, using buffer slots to prevent jams. Late boards raise speed and add tricky categories.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Rule hierarchy: Apply critical rules first (e.g., hazard vs non‑hazard) then fine categories.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Buffer discipline: Keep at least one buffer slot free at all times.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Batch easy items: Chain streaks on simple categories to maintain multipliers.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Error cost: Skip uncertain items rather than mis‑sort.
