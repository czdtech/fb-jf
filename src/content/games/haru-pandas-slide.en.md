### Detailed Game Introduction

Haru Pandas Slide presents image‑based sliding puzzles. Move tiles along rows/columns to restore adorable panda scenes. Later boards increase tile counts and introduce locked tiles that constrain pathing, rewarding planned sequences over trial‑and‑error.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Frame first: Complete the border to reduce search complexity.
2.  Solve bands: Reassemble distinct color bands (sky/forest/pandas) one at a time.
3.  Three‑move cycles: Use 3‑tile cycles to rotate positions without breaking placed areas.
4.  Lock awareness: Route moves around locked tiles; treat them as anchors.
5.  Minimal moves: Plan ahead to avoid undoing progress.
