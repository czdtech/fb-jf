### **Game Introduction**

This version puts you in direct control of a single cowboy hero. The gameplay is typically a side-scrolling or top-down shooter where you must run, jump, and shoot your way through levels filled with alien enemies. You collect new weapons (from revolvers to alien laser guns), power-ups, and health packs while dodging enemy projectiles and attacks. The goal is to survive each stage and defeat a boss at the end.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

#### **For Action/Shooter Games:**

1.  **Movement is Life**: Never stand still. Constantly be on the move to dodge incoming alien lasers and attacks. Learn enemy attack patterns to know when to jump, duck, or run.
2.  **Prioritize Threats**: Some aliens are more dangerous than others. Learn to quickly identify and eliminate high-priority targets first, such as long-range snipers or enemies that spawn smaller minions.
3.  **Conserve Ammunition/Power-ups**: If your game has limited ammo or timed power-ups, save them for large groups of enemies or difficult boss encounters. Don't waste your strongest attacks on weak, single aliens.
4.  **Know Your Arsenal**: Understand the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon. A shotgun is great for close-quarters crowd control, while a rifle is better for picking off distant foes. Switch weapons according to the situation.
