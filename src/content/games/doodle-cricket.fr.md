### Overview
Google’s playable cricket doodle: batters time swings to send the ball past fielders while the bowler varies speed and type. Runs accumulate until you’re out.

### How to Play
- Tap/Click to swing as the ball arrives; aim for gaps to score 1–6 runs.
- Watch bowler tells (slow/fast) and bounce; late swings tend to slice to off‑side.
- Your innings ends on a catch or a bowled/lbw; chase a new high score.

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch: single tap/click to bat. Timing determines placement and power.

### Tips
- Don’t pre‑swing—react to release and bounce.
- Favor ground strokes early; go aerial only when gaps are clear.
- Adjust to slower deliveries; wait a fraction longer.

### FAQ
- Q: Can I hit 6s consistently?
A: Yes, with late‑but‑clean contact when field is spread.
- Q: Does difficulty ramp?
A: Bowling speed/patterns vary as score increases.
- Q: How is score saved?
A: Typically local/session only.
