[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Brain Test 3: Tricky Quests* is the third installment in the series from Unico Studio. While preserving the core "think outside the box" and "break the rules" puzzle-solving gameplay, this title introduces a significant evolution by incorporating stronger adventure and narrative elements, making it feel more like a puzzle-adventure game.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] In the game, players take on the role of **Alyx**, who embarks on a journey to find six Power Gems to save her magically trapped father. Unlike the level-based structure of its predecessors, *Brain Test 3* features an interconnected game world and a complete, overarching storyline.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Key Features:**

*   **Fusion of Adventure and Puzzles:** The game is no longer a linear sequence of levels. Players must explore different scenes, find items, and use them to solve puzzles that block their path.
*   **Inventory System:** This is the biggest new feature. Players can collect various items found in the environment and store them in Alyx's backpack. You need to figure out how to combine these items or apply them to specific scenarios at the right moment.
*   **Workshop System:** Alyx has a workshop where you can combine key quest items or upgrade your tools, preparing you for the adventures ahead.
*   **Interactive Dialogue:** The game introduces a dialogue choice system. By talking to NPCs (Non-Player Characters), you can obtain clues and advance the plot. Different choices can lead to different (and often humorous) outcomes.
*   **Classic Tricky Puzzles:** Despite the new systems, the heart of the game remains the same: tricky puzzles that require you to use your imagination and challenge conventional thinking. Classic interactions like dragging, shaking, and zooming are still key to finding solutions.

### **2. Game Walkthrough**

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The strategy for *Brain Test 3* not only inherits the mindset of the previous games but also requires a greater focus on resource management and exploration.

*   **Core Principle: Explore and Collect**
    *   当进入新区域时，不要急于解决眼前的谜题。首先，仔细观察并点击所有可疑物体，看看哪些可以收集到你的物品栏中。
*   **Master Your Inventory:**
    *   **拖拽和使用：** 面对挑战时，打开背包，尝试将物品拖拽到场景中的角色或物体上。
    *   **组合物品：** 有时，你需要在物品栏中将两个物品拖到一起，以制作一个新的、更有用的工具。
    *   **检查所有物品：** 不要忘记你携带的东西。当前谜题的关键可能是你很久以前收集的一个不起眼的物品。
*   **Pay Attention to Clues in Dialogue:**
    *   仔细阅读所有对话。NPC的话语通常会直接或间接地暗示你接下来需要做什么或应该寻找什么物品。
*   **Checklist for When You're Stuck:**
    1.  我是否与场景中的每个元素都进行了互动？（点击、拖拽、摩擦等）
    2.  我的背包里有可以在这里使用的物品吗？
    3.  我可以在背包中组合物品来创建新工具吗？
    4.  我需要返回之前的场景寻找遗漏的物品吗？
    5.  我是否错过了对话中的关键信息？
*   **The Hint System is Still Your Friend:**
    *   如果一切都失败了，内置的"灯泡"提示系统仍然可用。它会指向关键步骤或所需物品，帮助你克服障碍。
