### Detailed Game Introduction

Jewel Pets Match is a bright and cheerful match-3 puzzle game filled with adorable, jewel-like animal characters. Your goal is to swap these cute pets on the game board to create lines of three or more identical animals. Each level presents a new challenge and a specific objective you must complete, such as reaching a target score or clearing special blocks, all within a limited number of moves.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Create Power-ups:** To master the game, you need to make matches of more than three pets.
    *   **Match 4:** Creates a special pet that can clear an entire row or column.
    *   **Match 5 (L or T shape):** Creates a bomb pet that explodes and clears a block of surrounding pets.
    *   **Match 5 (in a line):** Creates a rainbow pet that can clear all pets of a single type from the board.

2.  **Combine Boosters:** The most powerful moves in the game come from swapping two special pets next to each other. This triggers a massive combo effect that can clear a huge portion of the board at once.
3.  **Focus on the Objective:** Always keep the level's goal in mind. If you need to break ice blocks, make matches next to them. If you need to collect a certain number of a specific pet, prioritize those matches.
4.  **Plan Your Swaps:** With a limited number of moves, every action counts. Look for swaps that will create a chain reaction or set up a powerful combo on your next turn.
