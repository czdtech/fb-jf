<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
One‑button drifting on a floating track: tap/hold to drift at corners, release to straighten, and stay on the platform to bank coins for vehicle upgrades.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Anticipate corner entry; press to start a drift, release to exit.
- Narrow platforms and bumps require shorter, snappier holds.
- Coins unlock cars with better traction or stability.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Mouse/Space/Touch: hold to drift; release to go straight.

### Tips
- Look ahead for S‑bends; use micro‑taps instead of long holds.
- Don’t over‑correct—falling usually comes from late releases.
- Spend early on stability to survive longer tracks.
