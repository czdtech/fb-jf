### Game Introduction

Snakes and Ladders is a timeless classic board game, also known as Chutes and Ladders in some regions. Originating from ancient India, it's a game of pure luck where players race to be the first to reach the final square on the board. The journey is unpredictable, with ladders helping you climb closer to victory and snakes sliding you back down.

### Gameplay Guide

The objective is to be the first player to land on the final square (usually 100). Players take turns rolling a single die and moving their piece that number of spaces. If you land on a square at the base of a ladder, you immediately move up to the square at the top. Conversely, if you land on a square with a snake's head, you must slide down to the square at the snake's tail.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse/Touch:** Click or tap on the designated area to roll the die. The game will automatically move your piece.

**What happens if I roll a six?**
