### Game Introduction

"Minesweeper" is a classic single-player puzzle game. The objective is to uncover a grid of squares, find all hidden "mines" without detonating them. Through numerical clues, players can infer the number of mines hidden around each square, gradually clearing safe areas and marking minefields.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Understand Number Meanings**: Each numbered square indicates the count of mines in its eight surrounding adjacent squares.
2.  **Mark Safe Areas**: Based on numerical clues, identify squares that are safe to click and uncover.
3.  **Mark Minefields**: When a square is determined to be a mine, use a right-click (or long-press) to flag it, avoiding accidental detonation.
4.  **Prioritize Certainty**: Focus on areas where mines or safe squares can be definitively determined.
5.  **Handle Uncertainty**: In situations without clear clues, make reasonable guesses but try to minimize risk.

### How to Play

*   **Left-click**: Uncover a square.
*   **Right-click (or long-press)**: Flag or unflag a mine.
*   **Double-click Numbered Square**: When all mines around a numbered square have been correctly flagged, double-clicking that numbered square will instantly uncover all surrounding unrevealed safe squares.

    **A**: Minesweeper primarily relies on logical deduction, but for some purely randomly generated boards, there might be situations requiring guesswork, so there isn't a 100% guaranteed winning strategy.
2.  **Q: How can I customize the difficulty of Minesweeper?**
    **A**: Most Minesweeper games offer custom difficulty options, allowing you to adjust the board size and number of mines.
3.  **Q: Why do I sometimes encounter unwinnable situations?**
    **A**: In some randomly generated scenarios, it may be impossible to logically determine the next square, requiring a guess.
4.  **Q: What is the purpose of the timer in the game?**
    **A**: The timer records the time taken by the player to complete the game, allowing you to challenge your fastest record at different difficulty levels.
