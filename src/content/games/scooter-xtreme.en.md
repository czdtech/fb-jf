### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Master the Basics:** Before trying complex tricks, get comfortable with the controls. Practice accelerating, turning, and jumping to get a feel for the physics of the scooter.
2.  **Link Your Tricks:** The key to a high score is combos. Don't just do one trick; try to link them together. For example, jump off a ramp, do a flip in the air, and land perfectly in a grind on a rail.
3.  **Explore the Park:** The levels are filled with different paths and hidden areas. Explore the environment to find the best lines for scoring points and collecting all the coins.
4.  **Choose the Right Scooter:** As you unlock new scooters, pay attention to their stats. Some might be faster, while others might be better for performing tricks. Choose the one that best fits your playstyle and the level's objective.
