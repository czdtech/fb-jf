### Detailed Game Introduction

Fruit Chef channels classic fruit‑slicing: flick clean lines through flying fruit, build combo chains, and avoid bombs. The scoring engine rewards long, straight multi‑fruit cuts and steady rhythm over frantic swipes.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Long strokes: Slice multiple fruits in a single straight line for combo bonuses.
2.  Don’t chase lows: Let low fruit rise into a safe arc before slicing.
3.  Bomb discipline: Abort swipes that would cross bombs; safety first.
4.  Rhythm: Maintain a comfortable cadence; panic flutters reduce accuracy.
5.  Power‑ups: Save slow‑mo for dense volleys.

### Controls Guide

- Click‑drag or swipe to cut; avoid bombs; pause/retry via UI.
