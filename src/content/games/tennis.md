### Game Introduction

This is a classic arcade-style tennis game that captures the simple, addictive fun of the sport. Players control a tennis player on the court, competing against a computer-controlled opponent in a fast-paced match. The goal is to hit the ball back and forth, scoring points when your opponent fails to return it.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Objective:** Be the first player to win the required number of points or sets to win the match.
- **Serving:** Start each point by serving the ball over the net into the opponent's service box.
- **Rallying:** After the serve, hit the ball back and forth with your opponent. You must return the ball before it bounces twice on your side of the court.
- **Scoring:** You score a point if your opponent hits the ball out of bounds, into the net, or fails to return it before it bounces twice.

### Controls Guide

Controls are designed to be simple and intuitive:
- **Movement:** `Arrow Keys` or `WASD` to move your player around your side of the court.
- **Swing / Hit:** `Spacebar` or `X` key to swing your racket and hit the ball. The timing of your swing can affect the power and direction of the shot.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How do I score points in tennis?**

In a standard game, points are scored as 15, 30, 40, and then game point. You need to win by at least two points. Many arcade versions simplify this to just winning a set number of points (e.g., first to 7).

**How can I aim my shots?**

In most classic tennis games, your shot direction is determined by when you hit the ball relative to your player's body. Hitting it early sends it cross-court, while hitting it late sends it down the line.

**Can I play against another person?**

Many classic tennis games feature a 2-player mode where you can compete against a friend on the same keyboard.
