### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Blockbuster Puzzle tasks you with fitting incoming shapes to trigger line or cluster clears. The art is in pacing: keep multiple lanes viable, prepare “bomb” turns that clear large areas, and never burn your last escape pocket unless it secures a chain.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Keep two lanes free: Always preserve at least two flexible build lanes for awkward shapes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Bank a bailout slot: Reserve one pocket to recover from bad piece sets.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Cluster thinking: Group related shapes so one placement sets up several clears.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Avoid single‑cell cavities: These are nearly impossible to fill consistently.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Convert advantage: When the board is open, push for multi‑line clears to snowball space.

### Controls Guide

- Drag‑and‑drop pieces; rotate if supported.
- Undo/Reset can recover from greedy mistakes.
