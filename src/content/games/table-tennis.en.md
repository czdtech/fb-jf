### Detailed Game Introduction

Table Tennis is a fast-paced and engaging sports simulation game that brings the classic experience of ping-pong to your screen. Players compete against a computer-controlled opponent in a match where reflexes, timing, and strategy are key. The goal is to outscore your opponent by hitting the ball past them, adhering to the basic rules of table tennis. With intuitive controls and realistic physics, the game offers an accessible yet challenging experience for players of all skill levels.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Serve and Return:** Every point begins with a serve. The key is to hit the ball after it has bounced once on your side. When returning a shot, focus on the ball's trajectory and position your paddle accordingly.
2.  **Positioning is Key:** Try to keep your paddle centered after each shot. This "reset" position allows you to react more effectively to your opponent's returns, whether they are to your left or right.
3.  **Vary Your Shots:** Don't hit the ball to the same spot every time. Aim for the corners of the table to force your opponent to move, increasing the chances of them making a mistake. Mix up fast shots with slower, more strategic placements.
4.  **Observe the Opponent:** Pay attention to the AI's positioning and shot patterns. Sometimes you can anticipate where they will hit the ball next, giving you a crucial advantage in positioning your paddle for the return.

### Controls Guide

*   **`Mouse` Movement:** The paddle's movement is directly tied to your `mouse` cursor.
*   **Move Paddle:** Simply move your `mouse` left and right across your side of the table to position the paddle.
*   **Hit the Ball:** There is no need to `click`. Position your paddle in the ball's path, and it will automatically hit it on contact. The angle and speed of the return are influenced by where and how fast you move your paddle into the ball.
