### Detailed Game Introduction

Blockbuster Puzzle tasks you with fitting incoming shapes to trigger line or cluster clears. The art is in pacing: keep multiple lanes viable, prepare “bomb” turns that clear large areas, and never burn your last escape pocket unless it secures a chain.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Keep two lanes free: Always preserve at least two flexible build lanes for awkward shapes.
2.  **[DE]** Bank a bailout slot: Reserve one pocket to recover from bad piece sets.
3.  **[DE]** Cluster thinking: Group related shapes so one placement sets up several clears.
4.  **[DE]** Avoid single‑cell cavities: These are nearly impossible to fill consistently.
5.  **[DE]** Convert advantage: When the board is open, push for multi‑line clears to snowball space.

### Controls Guide

- Drag‑and‑drop pieces; rotate if supported.
- Undo/Reset can recover from greedy mistakes.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Why do I keep losing despite early good clears?

A: You’re over‑committing to one side and losing flexibility. Rebalance and keep a bailout pocket.

- Q: Is rotation required to win?

A: No, but it helps. When rotation is limited, rely on symmetry and larger open lanes.

- Q: Should I place big shapes first or last?

A: When the grid is tight, place the hardest shape first. When open, place to create multi‑line setups.
