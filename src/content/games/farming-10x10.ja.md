### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Farming 10x10 is a calm shape‑placement puzzle on a 10×10 grid. You receive sets of three pieces; place them to complete rows/columns and score clears. The run ends when no legal placements remain, so the art is in preserving flexibility while constructing multi‑line clears.
