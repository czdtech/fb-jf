### Detailed Game Introduction

Mazes offers a suite of labyrinths from simple grids to trap‑laden gauntlets. The challenge is route planning: finding shortest safe paths, avoiding trap tiles, and hitting switches to open gates while staying under par times.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Right/left‑hand rules: Use wall‑following on simply connected mazes; abandon on multi‑loops.
2.  **[FR]** Shortcut scouting: Zoom to spot door/switch pairs and plan a single sweep.
3.  **[FR]** Trap memory: Mark dangerous tiles mentally to avoid repeat hits.
4.  **[FR]** Time splits: Don’t chase a perfect line first; secure a finish, then optimize.
5.  **[FR]** Safe corridors: Favor wide lanes when precision is shaky.

### Controls Guide

- Drag or WASD to move; restart/undo if supported.

A: Route past every key junction; add a small detour rather than backtracking later.

- Q: Are traps random?

A: Usually fixed; learn their positions.

- Q: Any speedrun tip?
