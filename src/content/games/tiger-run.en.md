### Detailed Game Introduction

Tiger Run is a straightforward endless runner set in the jungle. Read upcoming hazards, swap lanes or jump/slide to avoid obstacles, and chain coin pickups while maintaining a stable rhythm as speed ramps up.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Eyes up: Look ahead to prepare lane swaps early.
2.  Priority safety: Skip side coins when gaps are tight.
3.  Memorize sets: Common obstacle patterns repeat—use them to pre‑position.
4.  Smooth inputs: Quick, small moves reduce overcorrection at high speed.
5.  Power‑ups: Save shields/magnets for dense sections.

### Controls Guide

- Move: A/D or Left/Right to change lanes.
- Jump/Slide: Space/Up to jump; Down to slide (or swipe on mobile).
- Pause/Retry: On‑screen UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I always clip hurdles—why? Time jumps slightly later and keep momentum steady.
- Any way to slow down? Some modes offer slow‑mo or temporary speed drops via power‑ups.
- Is there a finish? Usually endless—aim for new personal bests.
