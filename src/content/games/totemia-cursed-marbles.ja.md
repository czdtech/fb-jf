### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Totemia: Cursed Marbles is a thrilling action-puzzle game in the style of classic marble shooters like Zuma or Luxor. A chain of cursed, colored marbles is rolling along a path towards a secret chamber. You control a powerful tiki stone that shoots marbles. Your objective is to destroy the entire chain by shooting marbles to create matches of three or more of the same color before the first marble reaches the end of the line.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Aim for Combos:** The key to a high score and clearing levels efficiently is to create combos. When you pop a group of marbles, the chain will temporarily stop. If the two new ends of the chain are the same color, they will attract each other, pull back, and merge, often creating an automatic new match. This is a combo!
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Shoot Through Gaps:** Don't be afraid to shoot through small gaps in the chain to reach marbles further back. A well-aimed shot can set up a much more valuable match.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Use Power-ups:** Look for special marbles that appear in the chain. Shooting these can grant you powerful abilities, like a Fireball that can destroy any marbles it hits, or a Lightning bolt that zaps a section of the chain.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Swap Marbles:** Your tiki shooter often holds two marbles. If the current color isn't useful, you can swap it with the next one to make a better strategic shot.
