### Detailed Introduction

*Battleship* is a classic two-player strategy guessing game. The objective is to be the first to sink all of your opponent's warships. The game is played on two grids for each player: one grid represents your own ocean, where you secretly place your fleet of ships, and the other represents your opponent's ocean, which you use to track your guesses.

Before the battle begins, each player secretly arranges their ships on their own grid. A standard fleet consists of five ships of varying lengths, which must be placed either horizontally or vertically, and cannot overlap:
*   **Aircraft Carrier** (5 squares)
*   **Battleship** (4 squares)
*   **Cruiser** (3 squares)
*   **Submarine** (3 squares)
*   **Destroyer** (2 squares)

Once both players have placed their fleets, they take turns firing "shots" at the opponent's grid by calling out a coordinate (e.g., "D5"). The opponent must respond with either "Hit!" if a ship occupies that square, or "Miss!" if it's empty water. Players mark their opponent's grid with pegs or icons to record hits and misses, using this information to deduce the location of the enemy ships. A ship is considered "sunk" when all of its squares have been hit.

### Gameplay Strategy

Winning at *Battleship* involves a combination of clever placement and logical deduction.

#### Ship Placement Strategy (Defense):

1.  **Avoid the Obvious:** Many players tend to place ships along the edges or in the corners of the grid. Avoid these common spots to make your ships harder to find.
2.  **Don't Cluster:** Placing all your ships close together is risky. Once your opponent finds one ship, they will easily find the others nearby. Spread your fleet across the entire grid.
3.  **Don't Let Ships Touch:** If possible, place ships so that they are not adjacent to each other. This prevents an opponent from getting a hit on one ship and immediately finding another right next to it.
4.  **Embrace the Center:** Placing some ships, especially smaller ones, in the middle of the board can be effective, as many opponents focus their initial search patterns on the outer areas.

#### Firing Strategy (Offense):

1.  **Use a Search Pattern:** Do not fire randomly. The most effective strategy is to use a pattern that covers the board efficiently. A "checkerboard" or "parity" pattern is highly recommended. This means firing on every other square (e.g., A1, A3, A5, B2, B4, C1, C3, etc.). This guarantees you will find any ship on the board in fewer moves, as no ship can hide between the squares of your grid pattern.
2.  **Switch to "Hunt" Mode:** As soon as you get a "Hit," stop your search pattern. Now your goal is to determine the ship's orientation. Fire at the adjacent squares (above, below, left, and right) of the initial hit.
3.  **Sink the Ship:** Once you get a second consecutive hit, you know the ship's orientation (horizontal or vertical). Continue firing along that line until you get a "miss." This means you have found the end of the ship. Then, work your way down the other end until the ship is sunk.
4.  **Use Logic:** Keep track of which ships have been sunk. If you've already sunk the 2-square Destroyer, you know that any single hit in an open area must be part of a larger ship. This helps you eliminate possibilities and make smarter guesses.

### Controls Guide

For digital versions of *Battleship*, the controls are typically mouse-driven and very intuitive.

*   **Placement Phase:**
    *   **Select a Ship:** Click on a ship from your fleet.
    *   **Place a Ship:** Move your mouse over your grid to the desired location and click to place it.
    *   **Rotate a Ship:** Often there is a dedicated button to rotate the ship from horizontal to vertical, or you can use the right mouse button.
*   **Battle Phase:**
    *   **Fire a Shot:** Click on a square on the opponent's grid to fire at that coordinate.
    *   **Game Feedback:** The game will automatically mark the square as a hit (usually with a red marker or explosion) or a miss (with a white marker or splash icon).

### Frequently Asked questions (FAQ)

**1. What are the standard ships in a game of Battleship?**
The standard fleet includes an Aircraft Carrier (5 squares), a Battleship (4 squares), a Cruiser (3 squares), a Submarine (3 squares), and a Destroyer (2 squares).

**2. Can I place ships diagonally?**
No. In the standard rules of *Battleship*, ships can only be placed horizontally or vertically.

**3. Is it better to place my ships touching each other or separated?**
It is almost always better to place your ships so they are not touching. Spreading them out forces your opponent to start a new search pattern after sinking each ship, wasting their turns.

**4. Is the game just pure luck?**
No. While there is an element of luck in the initial search, the game heavily relies on strategy, logic, and deduction. A player with a good search pattern and logical thinking will consistently beat a player who guesses randomly.
