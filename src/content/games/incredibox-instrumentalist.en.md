### **Incredibox Instrumentalist Game Introduction**

*Incredibox Instrumentalist* is a highly innovative and beautifully designed fan-made mod. It fundamentally changes the core Incredibox presentation: instead of dragging icons onto a crew of performers, **players summon the instruments themselves directly onto the stage**, where they come to life and perform.

The mod's theme is a celebration of **global musical instruments**, creating a **purely instrumental** and vibrant world music orchestra. All 20 sound icons represent a diverse range of real instruments from various cultures and genres, including keyboards, accordions, maracas, stringed instruments, and a wide array of percussion. 

The objective is to allow players to compose rich, layered instrumental pieces by building their own unique orchestra. 

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

Strategy in *Incredibox Instrumentalist* revolves around understanding how different instruments complement each other to build a full-sounding ensemble.

1.  **Understand the Instrumental Sections**: All 20 icons represent a full orchestra.
    *   **Rhythm Section (Percussion)**: This forms the foundation. It includes icons like the hand drum, claves, maracas, tambourine, triangle, and various shakers (including one that resembles a soccer ball, likely a caxixi or similar rattle).
    *   **Harmony and Bass (Chords/Foundation)**: This section provides the harmonic structure. It includes instruments like the keyboard/organ and the accordion.
    *   **Melody (Leads)**: These are the lead instruments that play the main tunes. Look for icons representing trumpets, flutes, various stringed instruments (like the kora or mandolin), and the ocarina.
    *   **Textural Instruments**: This category includes instruments that add unique timbres and rhythmic complexity, such as the güiro (scraper) and the kazoo.

2.  **Build from the Rhythm Up**: A solid foundation is key. Start by summoning a few percussion instruments to establish a steady groove. A simple drum and maraca combination can set the stage perfectly.

3.  **Add the Harmonic Layer**: Once your rhythm is set, bring in an instrument that can play chords, like the keyboard or accordion. This will add depth and a harmonic structure to your composition.

4.  **Weave in the Melodies**: With the foundation in place, it's time for the lead instruments to shine. Layer a trumpet or flute melody on top of your rhythm and harmony to create a complete song.

5.  **Use Textural Instruments for Flavor**: Instruments like the güiro or kazoo are perfect for adding unique character and flavor to your mix. Drop them in to make your loop more interesting and dynamic.

### **Controls Guide**

This mod features a unique take on the classic Incredibox controls.

*   **Add an Instrument**: **Drag** a sound icon from the bottom and **drop** it onto one of the empty slots on the stage. The instrument itself will appear and start playing.
*   **Remove an Instrument**: Simply **click** on the instrument on the stage to remove it.
*   **Record**: Click the **record button** (top right) to start and stop recording your instrumental piece.
