### Detailed Game Introduction

Tangram Puzzle asks you to arrange seven geometric pieces (tans) to exactly fill a silhouette. No overlaps or gaps; rotations allowed, reflections sometimes banned depending on mode. Recognizing convex/concave pockets and matching corner angles is the key skill.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Corner matching: Seat large triangle corners into silhouette vertices first.
2.  **[DE]** Symmetry read: Split symmetric silhouettes and mirror your half‑solution.
3.  **[DE]** Pocket fills: Use square/parallelogram for tight cavities.
4.  **[DE]** Order of play: Rough‑in with big pieces, then lock gaps with small triangles.
5.  **[DE]** Reflection rules: If reflections are banned, rotate alternatives to simulate flips.

### Controls Guide

- Drag/rotate pieces; flip if allowed; snap assists on correct placement.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: One gap remains no matter what.

A: Your early placements are off by a corner; reseat a big triangle and re‑fit.

- Q: Are flips legal?

A: Some modes disallow flips; rely on rotations.
