### Detailed Game Introduction

Crocword blends crossword patterns with letter‑link mechanics. Connect letters to form valid words that fill crossword slots. Bonus words grant coins or hints; difficulty rises with longer, trickier grids.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Fill singular‑fit slots first (rare letter positions).
2.  Try anagrams of uncovered prefixes/suffixes.
3.  Use bonus words to stock hints for late game.
4.  Don’t tunnel — change angles (prefix/middle/suffix) when stuck.
5.  Build vocabulary lists (common digrams/trigrams) to speed solves.

### Controls Guide

- Drag across letters to form words; release to submit.
- Use hints to reveal letters/words sparingly.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: A slot seems impossible — help?
  
  A: Check crossing letters again; one mistake early can block several words.

- Q: Are proper nouns allowed?
  
  A: Most dictionaries disallow proper nouns; follow the game’s word list.

- Q: Can I replay for bonus words?
  
  A: Yes — revisit earlier grids to farm coins if the mode supports it.
