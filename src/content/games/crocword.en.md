### Detailed Game Introduction

Crocword blends crossword patterns with letter‑link mechanics. Connect letters to form valid words that fill crossword slots. Bonus words grant coins or hints; difficulty rises with longer, trickier grids.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Fill singular‑fit slots first (rare letter positions).
2.  Try anagrams of uncovered prefixes/suffixes.
3.  Use bonus words to stock hints for late game.
4.  Don’t tunnel — change angles (prefix/middle/suffix) when stuck.
5.  Build vocabulary lists (common digrams/trigrams) to speed solves.
