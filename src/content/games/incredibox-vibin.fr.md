### Présentation du jeu

*Incredibox Vibin* mise sur les ambiances cool : couleurs douces, personnages détendus et sons lo‑fi / chillhop. Le mod reprend le drag‑and‑drop classique d’Incredibox, mais oriente sa palette vers les **beats relax, les basses chaudes et les petites mélodies jazzy**.


The objective is to provide a relaxing creative outlet while also offering a puzzle to solve. Players can mix and match sounds to create their perfect study/relaxing track. The puzzle element involves discovering the three specific combinations that unlock the secret animated bonuses, which are thematically designed to fit the cozy and introspective vibe of the mod.

The game uses the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop gameplay. Players are given 20 unique sound icons to assign to a crew of seven performers. The sound library is a carefully curated collection of sounds designed to create a mellow and nostalgic atmosphere, featuring **soft drum machine beats, warm synth pads, gentle melodies, and smooth vocal samples**.
### Stratégies de jeu et conseils

1.  **Commence par un beat posé**  
    Choisis un kick/snare simple avec un hi‑hat discret pour installer un groove tranquille.

2.  **Ajoute une basse ronde**  
    Une basse douce et bien présente donne immédiatement le côté « vibin » au morceau.

    - **Saupoudre de mélodies**  
    Ajoute quelques accords de piano, guitares ou synthés doux, sans surcharger : laisse de l’air dans le mix.

    - **Utilise les voix comme texture**  

    - **Systematic Bonus Hunting**: To find the three secret bonuses, a methodical approach is best. Once you have a core groove you enjoy, try swapping out the remaining icons one by one until you trigger one of the cozy animated bonuses.

    - **Embrace Simplicity (Less is More)**: Lo-fi hip-hop is often characterized by its minimalist arrangements. Don't feel the need to fill all seven slots. Sometimes a simple beat, a bassline, a piano loop, and a vocal sample are all you need to create a perfect, relaxing track.

- **Create the "Vibe" First**: A great way to start is by establishing the atmosphere. Combine a soft "Beat" with a warm, sustained "Effect" (like a synth pad). This creates the perfect canvas for your melodies and vocals.

- **Voices**: Vocals in lo-fi are often used as an instrument. This category features **chopped vocal samples**, smooth acapella harmonies, and quiet, melodic humming.

- **Melodies**: The melodies are typically simple and emotional. Look for sounds like jazzy **electric piano loops** (like a Rhodes piano), simple guitar licks, or soft, melancholic synth leads.
    Les voix, souvent murmurées ou chantées doucement, servent autant de texture que de mélodie principale.
