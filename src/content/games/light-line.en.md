### Detailed Game Introduction

Light Line tasks you with drawing non‑overlapping paths that connect glowing nodes while obeying constraints: maximum turns, limited line length, mandatory pass‑throughs, or switches that toggle gates. Later puzzles add layered boards with energy sharing between lines.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with bottlenecks: Fill narrow corridors first; they force unique routes.
2.  Degree logic: Prioritize nodes with few exits; resolve them to reduce branching.
3.  Turn economy: Use long straight runs and save turns for corners that require them.
4.  Gate timing: Plan switch routes so gates open before line arrival.
5.  Backtrack early: Undo as soon as crossings become inevitable.

### Controls Guide

- `Drag` to draw/erase lines; `tap` switches; zoom/pan on dense boards.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:light-line:lines-always-collide-how-to-b8738577 -->
  Q: Lines always collide — how to avoid?
  
  A: Lay corridors first and route remaining lines around them; avoid spirals that trap space.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:light-line:are-diagonal-moves-allowed-b138326e -->
  Q: Are diagonal moves allowed?
  
  A: Usually grid‑orthogonal; check the level rules.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:light-line:is-there-a-hint-system-23e35ede -->
  Q: Is there a hint system?
  
  A: Many versions provide step or full‑path hints.
