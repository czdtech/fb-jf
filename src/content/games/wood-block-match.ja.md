### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Wood Block Match is a 10×10‑style block placement game with wooden aesthetics. Each turn you receive a batch of shapes; place them to complete rows/columns and clear space. The session ends when none of the remaining pieces fit — so success is about preserving flexible lanes while engineering multi‑line clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
