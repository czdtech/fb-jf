### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Perfect Piano is a fast-paced and engaging rhythm game that simulates playing the piano, similar to the popular "Piano Tiles" genre. Notes in the form of tiles fall from the top of the screen, and you must tap them at the precise moment they reach the bottom keyboard line.
