### Detailed Game Introduction

Space Survivor is an action-packed, roguelike survival game in the style of "Vampire Survivors." You pilot a spaceship that attacks automatically, and your only job is to skillfully navigate through ever-growing hordes of alien enemies. By defeating foes and collecting the experience gems they drop, you will level up and be able to choose from a variety of powerful new weapons and upgrades. Each run is different, challenging you to create a unique and overpowered build to survive for as long as possible.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Focus on Survival:** In the early game, your top priority is not getting hit. Weave through the enemy swarms and focus on collecting the blue experience gems they drop. Your initial weapon is weak, so dodging is more important than trying to kill everything.
2.  **Choose Your Upgrades Wisely:** Every time you level up, you get a choice of new weapons or upgrades. This is the core strategy of the game.
    *   **Synergy:** Try to pick weapons that work well together. For example, a weapon that slows enemies combined with a short-range, high-damage aura can be very effective.
    *   **Evolution:** Many weapons can be "evolved" into a much more powerful form if you have the correct corresponding passive item and have maxed out the weapon's level.
3.  **Keep Moving:** Never stand still. The enemies will swarm your last known position. Constant movement is key to staying alive, especially in the later stages when the screen is full of enemies.
4.  **Know When to Grab XP:** Sometimes it's dangerous to grab the XP gems immediately. It can be a good strategy to clear a large area first, then sweep back through to collect all the gems in safety.
