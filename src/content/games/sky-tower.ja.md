### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Sky Tower challenges you to drop moving floors onto a growing tower. Misalignments shear off overhangs, shrinking the platform. Clean timing produces tall, stable towers; sloppiness shrinks floors and ends runs early.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Center cue: Align to a background landmark to release consistently.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Late‑release bias: Drop just after alignment passes the center to compensate for human reaction.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Recovery floors: After a bad chop, slow down and re‑center before chasing height.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Rhythm: Maintain a steady cadence rather than reacting frantically.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Patience: Ignore coins during wobble; stabilize first.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click to drop floors; pause/replay via UI.
