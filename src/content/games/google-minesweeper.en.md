<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Minesweeper reveals numbers showing how many mines touch a cell. Use these clues to mark mines with flags and open safe cells, aiming to clear the board without detonating. Difficulty scales grid size and mine count.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Left‑click opens a cell; right‑click toggles a flag; chord/open around a number when flags match counts (host dependent).
- Use basic inferences (1‑1 pairs, 1‑2 patterns) to expand safely.
- On large boards, isolate corners/edges to reduce branching.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Mouse/touch; optional chording and quick‑open shortcuts vary by host.

### Tips
- Keep a consistent marking convention to avoid misflags.
- When forced to guess, choose tiles that reveal the most info if wrong.
- Edges often constrain layouts—scan along borders for sure moves.

### FAQ
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:google-minesweeper:how-do-i-avoid-guessing-ac9c1119 -->
  Q: How do I avoid guessing in Minesweeper?
  A: Use pattern sets and parity checks; some positions remain 50/50.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:google-minesweeper:what-does-the-number-on-5da60ba9 -->
  Q: What does the number on a cell indicate?
  A: It equals the count of adjacent mines among the eight neighbors.
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:google-minesweeper:does-difficulty-only-change-bo-92c48de2 -->
  Q: Does difficulty only change board size?
  A: It changes both size and mine density.
