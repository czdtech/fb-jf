### **Game Introduction**

This popular fan-made mod for Incredibox is a direct tribute to the massively popular VR game, **Incredibox Banana**. It swaps the usual beatboxers for a crew of gorillas sitting on a log in a forest environment, perfectly capturing the aesthetic of its inspiration.

The gameplay follows the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop formula. Players are given 20 sound icons, each representing a different sound or meme from the Incredibox Banana community. By dragging these icons onto the seven gorillas, players can create their own unique musical compositions. The sound palette is a creative mix of **jungle ambiance, meme sound effects from the game, beatboxing, and electronic beats**.

The objective is to allow fans of both Incredibox and Incredibox Banana to express their creativity while also enjoying the puzzle of finding the secret animated bonuses, which are undoubtedly themed around the unique culture of the Incredibox Banana universe.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

The strategy here is about layering the game's iconic sounds and meme references to create a fun, energetic track.

1.  **[KO]** **Understand the Incredibox Banana Sound Palette**:
    *   **[KO]** **Beats (Percussion)**: The rhythm section is likely composed of jungle-themed percussion. Look for icons like the **coconut** to provide a beat, or other sounds that create a rhythmic pulse.
    *   **[KO]** **Effects (Atmosphere)**: This category builds the world. It likely includes ambient forest sounds, character sound effects, and iconic meme sounds like the **plunger** or the spooky sound associated with the **PBBV** icon (a famous Incredibox Banana myth).
    *   **[KO]** **Melodies (Bass/Synth)**: These are the core tunes. Icons like the **headphones** might represent a deep bassline or a synth melody that drives the track.
    *   **[KO]** **Voices (Vocal)**: The vocals would be a mix of gorilla-like chants, beatboxing, and other character vocalizations that give the mix its unique personality.

2.  **[KO]** **Embrace the Meme Culture**: A huge part of the fun is recognizing the references. The icons for the **PBBV bowtie**, the various hats, and other in-game items are all nods to Incredibox Banana lore. Experiment with these to see how they translate into music.

3.  **[KO]** **Build from the Ground Up**: Start your mix with a solid beat (perhaps the coconut icon). Then add a bassline or an atmospheric effect to create a foundation. Finally, layer the more distinct melodies and vocals on top.

4.  **[KO]** **Systematic Bonus Hunting**: To find the three secret bonuses, be methodical. Lock in a few core sounds that you think work well together, then systematically swap out the remaining icons one by one until you trigger an animation.

### **Controls Guide**

The controls follow the standard, intuitive drag-and-drop interface of the official Incredibox games.

*   **[KO]** **Add a Sound**: **Drag** a sound icon from the bottom and **drop** it onto one of the gorillas.
*   **[KO]** **Remove a Sound**: Click the "X" on an active sound icon at the bottom, or drag a new sound onto an existing gorilla to replace it.
*   **[KO]** **Mute / Unmute**: **Click** on a performing gorilla to mute them; click again to unmute.
*   **[KO]** **Solo**: Click the **small button** next to an active gorilla to mute all other performers.
*   **[KO]** **Record**: Click the **record button** (top right) to start and stop recording your mix.
