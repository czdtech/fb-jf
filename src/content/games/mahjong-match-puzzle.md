### Detailed Game Introduction

Mahjong Match Puzzle uses layered stacks where only open tiles (no cover, at least one free side) can be matched. Some boards introduce connect‑style paths or special tiles. Efficiency comes from freeing caps, preserving options, and avoiding early removal that seals deeper pairs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Cap removal: Free and remove top caps to expose large areas quickly.
2.  Rarity first: Clear rare symbols early to prevent late deadlocks.
3.  Side access: Keep side lanes open; avoid sealing long strips.
4.  Hint reserve: Save hints/shuffles for when new openings stop appearing.
5.  Pace: Don’t rush — deliberate picks trump speed.

### Controls Guide

- Select two matching open tiles to remove; use hints/shuffles per UI.
