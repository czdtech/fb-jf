### Overview
Henry Stickmin’s biggest breakout: make choices, use gadgets, and navigate route branches to escape, with many joke failures and several successful endings.

### How to Play
- Pick options during scenes; quick‑time prompts require timely clicks.
- Explore the main route splits to find all endings.
- Use scene select (where available) to complete fails/bios.

### Controls
- Mouse to choose options and interact; keys for occasional prompts vary by host.

### Tips
- When an option fails, try the alternate route—many scenes have a “correct” path.
- Click characters during scenes to record bios if the version supports it.
- Keep a checklist of endings to avoid repeats.

### FAQ
- Q: How many endings does the game include?  
  A: There are multiple successful endings across the major route branches.
- Q: Do I need to react quickly in every scene?  
  A: Only some scenes require quick clicks; most are menu choices.
- Q: Can I rewatch scenes to collect everything?  
  A: Yes, many hosts provide scene selection for cleanup.
