### Detailed Game Introduction

Jigsaw Puzzle Deluxe brings the timeless and relaxing activity of solving jigsaw puzzles to your screen. The game offers a vast collection of beautiful, high-quality images across various categories. Players can choose their preferred picture and select a difficulty level, which determines how many pieces the puzzle is divided into. The goal is to correctly assemble all the scattered pieces to recreate the original image.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Build the Frame First:** A classic and highly effective jigsaw strategy is to start by finding all the edge and corner pieces. Assembling the border of the puzzle first provides a clear frame within which you can work.
2.  **Sort by Color and Pattern:** Once the frame is built, look at the remaining pieces. Sort them into groups based on their dominant colors or distinct patterns. If the picture has a blue sky, gather all the blue pieces together.
3.  **Focus on a Section:** Instead of trying to place pieces randomly, focus on completing one specific area of the picture at a time. For example, try to assemble a single object or building within the image.
4.  **Use the Preview:** If you get stuck or forget what the final image looks like, use the "Preview" or "Hint" button to get a quick look at the completed picture for reference.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple `drag`-and-`drop` controls.

*   **Move a Piece:** `Click` and `hold` on a puzzle piece and `drag` it to the desired position on the board. Release to `drop` it into place.
*   **Rotate a Piece (if applicable):** Some difficulty modes may include rotated pieces. There will typically be a button or keyboard key to rotate a selected piece.
