### Detailed Game Introduction

Speed Master is a minimalist reaction game that pushes timing and focus. Prompts sweep across the screen; you must tap at the exact overlap window. Difficulty rises with faster sweeps, deceptive rhythms, and multi‑lane inputs that punish early flinches and late presses alike.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Beat counting: Lock to a steady internal count; tap to beat rather than pure sight.
2.  Peripheral prediction: Track the next prompt while executing the current one.
3.  Late‑bias safety: Slightly late taps are safer than early (most engines accept late end‑frames).
4.  Two‑lane focus: Keep eyes between lanes; don’t hard‑fixate on one side.
5.  Regain cadence: After a miss, breathe, realign posture, then continue.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/press when prompts reach markers; multi‑lane binds use arrow/WASD (varies). Pause/Retry via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:speed-master:im-consistently-early-how-do-ba457e23 -->
  Q: I’m consistently early — how do I fix it?
  
  A: Add a micro‑delay to your count and look for the exact overlap instead of chasing the sweep.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:speed-master:multilane-overwhelms-me-d2d7a3f5 -->
  Q: Multi‑lane overwhelms me.
  
  A: Soften focus and watch the center gap; process lanes peripherally.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:speed-master:does-fps-matter-c4d00307 -->
  Q: Does FPS matter?
  
  A: Stable framerate helps; close background apps if timing feels inconsistent.
