### Detailed Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Bank Robbery 2* is a team-based, first-person shooter game where players are divided into two opposing factions: Cops and Robbers. The game revolves around a central, high-stakes objective: a bank heist.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] As a **Robber**, the goal is to infiltrate a heavily secured bank, use a drill to break into vaults and safes, steal as much cash as possible, and successfully transport it to a designated getaway point. This requires coordination, firepower, and a solid plan to bypass security and fight off the police force.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] As a **Cop**, the objective is to defend the bank and uphold the law. This involves preventing the Robbers from breaching the vault, defusing any drills they manage to place, and eliminating the criminal team before they can escape with the money. Success as a cop relies on strategic positioning, teamwork, and quick response to the Robbers' actions.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game takes place in an urban environment with the bank as the focal point. Players can use a variety of weapons, tools, and vehicles to achieve their team's goals, earning in-game currency to purchase better equipment for future rounds.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Success is highly dependent on which team you are on.

#### For Robbers:

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Plan Your Entry:** Don't just rush the front door. Scout for alternative entry points like back alleys, side doors, or even rooftop access. A coordinated, multi-pronged attack can confuse the police.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Assign Roles:** Don't have everyone do the same thing. Designate specific roles: one or two players to place and guard the drill, one to watch the main entrance, and another to cover flanking routes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Protect the Drill:** The drill is your key to the money, but it's noisy and takes time, making it a magnet for Cops. Set up defensive positions around the drilling area and hold your ground.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **The Escape is a Separate Mission:** Getting the money is only half the battle. Once you have the cash bags, you become a high-priority target. Plan your escape route in advance and consider having a designated getaway driver ready with a vehicle.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Upgrade Your Gear:** Use the money you earn from successful heists to buy better weapons, stronger armor, and useful tools like C4 for faster breaching.

#### For Cops:

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Secure All Entrances:** At the start of the round, don't just camp the main lobby. Spread out to cover all potential points of entry. A single robber slipping through can start a drill and put your team at a disadvantage.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Communicate and Call Out:** Use the team chat to report enemy locations. Announce where the robbers are drilling ("Drill on the main vault!") so your team can converge on the threat.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Coordinated Retakes:** If robbers have taken control of an area, don't rush in one by one. Group up and breach the room together from multiple angles to overwhelm them.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Prioritize Defusing the Drill:** If a drill is active, stopping it is your top priority. Provide cover for a teammate who is attempting to defuse it, as they will be completely vulnerable during the process.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Cut Off the Escape:** If the robbers manage to grab the money, your objective shifts to interception. Use police cars to chase them down or set up roadblocks on the path to their getaway point.

### よくある質問（FAQ）
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] You earn in-game cash by completing objectives (stealing money as a robber, stopping robbers as a cop) and eliminating opponents. You can then use this cash in the game's shop to purchase a wide variety of new guns, armor, and tools.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. As a Robber, the drill keeps getting defused. What should I do?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Teamwork is the only solution. You cannot leave the drill unattended. You need at least one or two teammates dedicated to defending the area while the drill is running.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. As a Cop, we are always overwhelmed. How can we defend better?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Avoid grouping up in one predictable spot. Use the entire bank as your defense area. By spreading out, you can get early warnings of where the robbers are attacking from and flank them when they commit to drilling a specific vault.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. What is the best way to enter the bank as a Robber?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] There is no single "best" way, as it depends on how the Cops set up their defense. The most effective strategy is often a surprise attack. Using C4 on a side wall or finding an unguarded back entrance is usually more successful than a direct assault on the front doors.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **5. Can I switch teams during a game?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Typically, team selection happens before the round begins, and you are locked into that team until the next game to maintain balance.
