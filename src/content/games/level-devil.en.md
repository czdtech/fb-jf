<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Level Devil is a trick platformer where the stage betrays you—tiles crumble, spikes pop up mid‑jump, and exits move. Success demands cautious probing, reading visual tells, and memorizing trap locations rather than rushing.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Nudge forward to trigger traps safely, then proceed.
- Watch for slight pixel differences that hint at fake floors or spikes.
- Checkpoints (when provided) reward measured progress.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Arrows/`WASD` to move/jump; restart keys vary by host.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Don’t sprint blind; test ledges with short hops first.
- Expect traps near obvious “safe” tiles and exits.
- Count beats between moving hazards to time jumps.
