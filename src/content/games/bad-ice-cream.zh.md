### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Bad Ice-Cream* is the first game in the beloved 2D pixel-art arcade puzzle series. The player takes control of a "bad" ice cream character, tasked with a simple but challenging goal: navigate through 40 icy, maze-like levels and collect every piece of fruit on the screen.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is defined by its core mechanic: the ability to instantly create or destroy rows of ice blocks. This powerful tool is used for everything from creating bridges to reach fruit, to building defensive walls against the various monsters that patrol each level. These enemies move in predictable patterns, and if they touch the player, a life is lost. The game features a timer, adding a sense of urgency to each stage. It can be played either solo or with a friend in a fantastic two-player cooperative mode on a single keyboard, which has become a hallmark of the series.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] To succeed, players must blend quick thinking with strategic planning.

#### 1. Master the Ice Wall
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Your ice-building ability is your most important asset.
*   **Create Barriers:** The most basic and crucial strategy is to build walls of ice to block incoming enemies. This allows you to create safe zones to collect fruit.
*   **Trap Your Foes:** Lure an enemy into a narrow path and then seal both ends with ice. This takes them out of play temporarily, giving you free reign over that area of the map.
*   **Build Bridges:** Sometimes, fruit is located in an open area you can't reach. Build a line of ice blocks to create a path for yourself.
*   **Controlled Destruction:** Just as important as creating ice is destroying it. Break through your own walls to create escape routes or to reach the next cluster of fruit.

#### 2. Plan Your Route
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Don't just run around randomly. At the start of a level, take a brief moment to scan the locations of the fruit and enemies. Try to collect fruit in groups. Clearing one corner of the map before moving on is far more efficient than crisscrossing the entire level.

#### 3. Observe Enemy Patterns
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The enemies in *Bad Ice-Cream* are not intelligent; they follow simple, repeating paths. Watch them for a moment. Understanding their movement allows you to predict where they will be, making it much easier to avoid them or trap them.

#### 4. Balance Speed and Caution
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The timer adds pressure, but rushing is the number one cause of losing a life. Work methodically. Create a safe pocket, clear the fruit inside, then break out and create your next safe zone.

#### 5. Two-Player Strategy
*   **Divide and Conquer:** The most effective method in co-op is to split the map. Have one player work on the left side and the other on the right. This is the fastest way to collect all the fruit.
*   **The Decoy:** One player can intentionally draw the attention of multiple enemies, leading them on a chase while the other player safely collects fruit in another area.
*   **Watch Out for Each Other:** Be careful not to trap your partner with an ice wall! Communication (or at least paying attention to your partner's location) is key.

### Controls Guide

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is designed to be easily played by two people on one keyboard.

*   **Player 1:**
    *   **移动：** 方向键（`↑`、`↓`、`←`、`→`）
    *   **动作（创建/破坏冰块）：** `空格键`

*   **Player 2:**
    *   **移动：** `W`、`A`、`S`、`D` 键
    *   **动作（创建/破坏冰块）：** `F` 键

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: Can I kill the enemies?**
    *   **A:** 不能。你不能直接伤害或杀死游戏中的敌人。你唯一的选择是避开它们或用冰块困住它们。

*   **Q: What is the goal of each level?**
    *   **A:** 目标是在计时器用完之前收集屏幕顶部显示的100%的水果。

*   **Q: Do the different types of fruit do anything special?**
    *   **A:** 不，不同的水果（香蕉、樱桃等）纯粹是装饰性的，并且在不同关卡之间会发生变化。它们的功能是相同的：你必须收集所有水果才能获胜。

*   **Q: How does the 2-player mode work?**
    *   **A:** 两个玩家同时在同一屏幕上，共同收集水果。你们共享一个生命池，所以如果任何一个玩家被敌人抓住，你们的团队就会失去一条生命。
