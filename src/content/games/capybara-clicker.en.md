### Game Introduction

Capybara Clicker is a charming and relaxing idle/clicker game centered around the internet's favorite calm animal, the capybara. The objective of the game is to generate an ever-increasing number of capybaras.

The gameplay starts simply: the player clicks on a large capybara in the center of the screen, with each click generating one capybara. These generated capybaras act as the game's currency. You can spend them on two main types of upgrades: upgrades that increase the number of capybaras you get per click, and auto-generating upgrades that produce a steady stream of capybaras per second (CPS) without you having to do anything. As you accumulate more capybaras, you unlock new cosmetic items to dress up your main capybara and can trigger a "weather change," which acts as a prestige system to reset your progress in exchange for a permanent boost to your production rate.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Balance Clicks and Idle Generation:** In the very beginning, active clicking is your main source of income. However, the long-term goal is to build up your passive Capybaras Per Second (CPS). Your first few purchases should be the cheapest auto-generating upgrades to get the snowball rolling.
-   **Invest in Auto-Generation:** The key to exponential growth in any clicker game is passive income. Always prioritize buying new auto-generating sources or upgrading your existing ones. They work for you even when you're not actively clicking.
-   **Know When to Change the Weather (Prestige):** The "Ascend" or "Prestige" button in this game is the weather icon. Clicking it will reset your current capybaras and upgrades but will grant you a permanent boost to all future earnings.
    -   Don't be afraid to ascend. The boost you get makes regaining your progress much, much faster.
    -   A good rule of thumb is to ascend when your progress starts to slow down significantly and the next upgrade seems impossibly far away.
-   **Don't Forget Click Upgrades:** While passive income is key, don't completely ignore the "per click" upgrades. After you ascend, your powerful manual clicks can help you quickly buy back your first few auto-generating buildings.
-   **Unlock Everything:** Reaching population milestones will unlock new skins and hats for your capybara. These are cosmetic but are fun goals to aim for.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:capybara-clicker:what-is-the-point-of-e675f3f2 -->
**1. What is the point of the game?**
> The goal is simply to see the numbers go up! It's a relaxing, low-stress game about achieving ridiculously large numbers and unlocking fun cosmetic items. It's a classic example of an incremental or idle game.

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:capybara-clicker:should-i-keep-clicking-or-54f7c23f -->
**2. Should I keep clicking or save up for auto-generators?**
> In the beginning, click a lot to afford your first few auto-generating upgrades. Once you have a decent CPS, you can let the game idle and check back in to buy more upgrades. The focus should shift from clicking to managing your passive income.

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:capybara-clicker:what-does-changing-the-weather-b6224f4a -->
**3. What does changing the weather do?**
> Changing the weather is the game's "prestige" or "ascension" mechanic. It resets your progress (capybaras, upgrades) but gives you a permanent percentage-based boost to all future capybara generation. This is essential for long-term progress.

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:capybara-clicker:how-do-i-unlock-the-008a68ac -->
**4. How do I unlock the new hats and skins?**
> You unlock new cosmetic items by reaching specific population milestones (e.g., 1 billion capybaras, 1 trillion, etc.). The game will notify you when a new item is available.
