### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bubble Trouble is a fast-paced arcade action game. The player controls a small, devil-like character at the bottom of the screen who can only move left and right. The objective is to clear the screen of all bouncing bubbles before the timer runs out.
The controls are simple and designed for quick arcade action.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The core mechanic involves shooting a harpoon-like projectile straight up. When the harpoon hits a bubble, the bubble pops and splits into two smaller bubbles. These smaller bubbles continue to bounce around the screen. This process repeats—popping a bubble creates two smaller ones—until the bubbles reach their smallest size, at which point popping them removes them from the game completely.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The main challenge is to avoid being touched by any of the bouncing bubbles. If a bubble hits the player's character, they lose a life. The game is lost if the player runs out of lives or if the timer reaches zero. As players progress, levels become more difficult with more bubbles, complex starting layouts, and shorter time limits. The game also features a popular two-player cooperative mode.

### Gameplay Strategy
**1. Is it possible to shoot diagonally?**（日本語訳が必要）

-   **Prioritize the Largest Bubbles:** Always try to pop the biggest bubbles first. They are the most dangerous because they cover the most area and create the most subsequent smaller bubbles. Getting them out of the way early reduces the overall chaos.
    - **Double Harpoon:** Lets you shoot two projectiles at once.（日本語訳が必要）
### コントロール Guide
- **Player 1:**（日本語訳が必要）
- **Two-Player Coordination:** In 2-player mode, communication is key. The best strategy is often to "divide and conquer." Each player takes one half of the screen. This prevents you from running into each other and provides much better screen coverage.（日本語訳が必要）
    - **A and D Keys:** 移動する the character left and right.
- **Player 2:**（日本語訳が必要）
    - **Q Key:** 撃つ harpoon.
*(Note: Player 2 controls can sometimes vary slightly, e.g., using X and C for movement and W to shoot, depending on the version of the game.)*（日本語訳が必要）
-   **Stay Under the Bubble:** A good general strategy is to position yourself directly underneath a bubble before firing. This gives you the maximum amount of time to react and move out of the way of the two smaller bubbles that will be created and bounce outwards.
-   **Corner Trapping:** One of the most effective tactics is to trap a bubble in a corner. When a bubble is bouncing predictably between a wall and your harpoon line, you can stand in a safe spot and fire repeatedly until it's completely destroyed.
    - **Dynamite:** Pops all bubbles of a certain size on the screen.（日本語訳が必要）
-   **Master the Power-ups:** Popping bubbles will sometimes drop power-ups. Collecting these is crucial for success. Key power-ups include:
    - **Spacebar:** 撃つ harpoon.
    - **Left/Right Arrow Keys:** 移動する the character left and right.
    - **A and D Keys:** 移動する the character left and right.
