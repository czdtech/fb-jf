### Detailed Game Introduction

Cricket Mania captures fast batting sessions. Read line and length, pick appropriate shots, and time swings to beat field placements and rack up runs under target pressures.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Shot selection: Play with the line—leg glance for pads, cover for off‑side.
2.  Timing window: Swing slightly late for leg‑side, earlier for off‑side drives.
3.  Target focus: Track required run rate; rotate strike when boundaries dry up.
4.  Risk control: Avoid aerials when fielders camp deep.
5.  Power plays: Use gaps aggressively when the field is in.

### Controls Guide

- Aim shot with directional input; tap to swing on time.
- Runs tally automatically; watch prompts for special shots.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Keep getting caught? You’re lofting into deep field—favor ground shots.
- Miss timing? Watch bowler’s release, not just ball flight.
- Can I bowl? Most versions focus on batting only.
