<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Head Soccer condenses football to punchy 1v1 duels with oversized heads and simple physics. Matches last seconds to minutes; power‑ups and special shots create swing moments. Win by outscoring within the timer or golden‑goal rules.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Position under lobs for headers; volley low balls for speed.
- Trigger specials when the goal is open; block with timely jumps.
- In two‑player, divide roles—pressure vs. coverage.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- Arrows/`WASD` to move/jump; shoot/special keys vary by host.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Early jump + tap shot produces fast low drives.
- Save specials for counterattacks or rebounds.
- Defensively, stand slightly off‑line to angle clearances.
