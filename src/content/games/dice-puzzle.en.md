### Detailed Game Introduction

Dice Puzzle is a clever and strategic puzzle game that blends logic with a bit of luck. The objective is to place dice onto a 5x5 grid and merge them to create higher-value dice. By matching three or more adjacent dice of the same number, you combine them into a single die of the next higher number. The ultimate goal is to create special jewel cubes by merging dice with the number 6, which helps clear the board and achieve a high score. The game ends when the board is full and you can no longer place a die.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Merge Rule:** The core of the game is matching three or more identical dice that are adjacent to each other (in a line or cluster). They will then merge into a single die of the next number (e.g., three '4s' become one '5').
2.  **Plan Your Placements:** Don't just place a die in the first available spot. Look at the existing dice on the board and try to place your new die where it can either complete a set of three or set up a future merge.
3.  **Rotate for a Better Fit:** You can rotate the die before you place it. Use this to your advantage to position it perfectly for a merge.
4.  **Aim for the Jewel Cube:** The most powerful move is to merge three dice with the number 6. This creates a special jewel cube that will explode, clearing a 3x3 area around it. This is crucial for freeing up space on the board and extending your game.
