### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Parking Jam is a Rush‑Hour style puzzle: slide cars along their lanes to clear the path for the target vehicle. Higher levels cram lots with multi‑length cars, one‑way arrows, and blockers requiring precise order of operations.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Goal backchain: Work backward from the exit to identify cars that truly gate progress.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Minimal moves: Prefer moves that unlock multiple vehicles rather than local shuffles.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Buffer lanes: Open a buffer lane early to allow deeper rearrangements.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Priority stack: Park non‑critical cars in dead zones to keep corridors free.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Undo early: If progress stalls, rewind before the last “dead shuffle” and choose a different unlock.

### Controls Guide

- Drag cars along permitted axes; undo/reset via UI.
