### Detailed Game Introduction

Bowling Stars is a casual ten‑pin bowling sim featuring aim, power, and hook control. Consistency and spare conversion define high scores—dial in your release and adapt to lane behavior to string together strikes.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Pocket hits: For right‑handers, aim between the 1–3 pins; left‑handers, 1–2 pocket.
2.  Control the hook: Add gentle curve so the ball enters the pocket at an angle for better pin action.
3.  Spare system: Memorize spare angles (e.g., 7‑pin and 10‑pin) and use cross‑lane shots.
4.  Tempo matters: A smooth, repeatable release beats random power spikes.
5.  Adjust quickly: If you leave frequent splits, shift your starting line or reduce hook.

### Controls Guide

- Aim: Drag left/right to set line.
- Power: Hold/release to set speed.
- Hook: Drag/tilt while rolling or set a spin parameter before release.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- How to reduce splits? Enter the pocket at a controllable angle; too steep or too flat increases split chances.
- Any tip for 7/10? Use cross‑lane shots with enough angle; prioritize spare consistency over hero plays.
- Why do I miss light/heavy? Adjust starting position or hook strength by small increments.
