### Detailed Game Introduction

Road Fury is a high-octane, top-down vertical scrolling shooter that puts you in the driver's seat of a heavily armed vehicle on a chaotic highway. Your mission is to survive for as long as possible against waves of enemy cars, trucks, and bosses. Weave through traffic, collect powerful boosters, and use the coins you earn from destroyed enemies to upgrade your car's weapons and armor to unleash maximum fury.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Constant Movement:** The key to survival is to never stop moving. Weave left and right to dodge enemy fire and collisions. Staying in one place is the fastest way to get destroyed.
2.  **[ES]** **Grab Power-ups:** Prioritize collecting the power-ups that appear on the road. A temporary shield, a powerful rocket launcher, or a coin magnet can dramatically change the course of your run.
3.  **[ES]** **Focus on Upgrades:** The coins you collect are crucial. Between runs, visit the garage to permanently upgrade your vehicle. Upgrading your main cannon's damage and your car's armor are excellent first choices.
4.  **[ES]** **Learn Enemy Patterns:** Different enemy vehicles have different behaviors. Some will try to ram you, while others will shoot from a distance. Learn their patterns to anticipate their attacks and dodge them effectively.
