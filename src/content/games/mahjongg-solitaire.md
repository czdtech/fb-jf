### Game Introduction

Mahjongg Solitaire, also known as Mahjong Solitaire or Shanghai Solitaire, is a popular single-player tile-matching puzzle game. The game uses a set of Mahjong tiles arranged in various multi-layered layouts. The primary objective is to clear the entire board by finding and matching pairs of identical, "free" tiles.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Matching Tiles:** Click or tap on two identical tiles to remove them.
- **"Free" Tiles:** Only tiles that are "free" can be matched. A tile is free if it has no other tiles directly on top of it and at least one of its long sides (left or right) is unobstructed.
- **Strategy:** Plan your moves carefully. Removing certain tiles might block others, making the game unsolvable. Prioritize removing tiles that are blocking many other tiles or those that are part of a critical stack.
- **Special Tiles:** Flower and Season tiles can be matched with any other tile of their respective group, even if they are not identical.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse/Touch:** Use your mouse or finger to click/tap on the tiles to select them.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is the goal of Mahjongg Solitaire?**

The goal is to remove all 144 tiles from the board by matching them in pairs.

**What happens if I can't find any more matches?**

If there are no more available "free" pairs to match, and tiles still remain on the board, the game is lost. Some digital versions offer a "shuffle" or "hint" option.

Some versions of Mahjongg Solitaire are timed, adding an element of urgency, while others allow for a more relaxed pace.
