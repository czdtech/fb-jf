### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Basket Battle is a snappy, physics‑leaning basketball mini‑game. Line up arcs, control timing, and manage rebounds to edge opponents in short, hectic rounds.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Arc aiming: Higher arcs drop softer and score more consistently.
2.  Rebounds: Box out after shots to secure second‑chance points.
3.  Tempo: Shoot quickly off rebounds before defense resets.
4.  Shot selection: Avoid flat drives from deep; step in for better odds.
5.  Mind wind (if any): Offset aim when wind appears.

### Controls Guide

- Aim/Power: Drag to aim, release to shoot.
- Move/Jump (if available) via arrows/buttons.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Shots rim out—why? Too flat or over‑powered; raise arc and reduce power.
- Can I dunk? Depends on mode; close‑range jumps may allow it.
- Multiplayer? Often local head‑to‑head.
