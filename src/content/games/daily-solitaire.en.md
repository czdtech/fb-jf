### Detailed Game Introduction

Daily Solitaire offers a fresh Klondike Solitaire puzzle every day. The game presents the classic challenge of sorting a 52-card deck into four foundation piles by suit, from Ace to King. With a new, guaranteed-winnable deal each day, it's a perfect way to test your skills, track your progress, and enjoy a moment of classic card game strategy.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Objective:** Move all 52 cards to the four foundation piles in ascending order (Ace to King) for each suit.
2.  **Tableau Management:** Build columns on the tableau in descending order, alternating colors (e.g., a red Jack on a black Queen). The primary goal is to uncover face-down cards.
3.  **Prioritize Empty Columns:** Creating an empty column is a powerful move, as it can only be filled by a King. This gives you a valuable space to rearrange long sequences and uncover more cards.
4.  **Stock and Waste:** When no more moves are available on the tableau, draw from the stock pile to reveal new cards. Use these cards to build on the tableau or move them directly to the foundation.

### Controls Guide

*   **Move Cards:** Click and drag cards between piles.
*   **Draw from Stock:** Click the stock pile to deal a new card to the waste pile.
*   **Auto-Move:** Double-clicking a card will often send it to the appropriate foundation pile if the move is valid.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: Is the daily puzzle always winnable?**
    *   **A:** Yes, most "Daily Solitaire" games feature deals that are guaranteed to have at least one winning path, though it may be very tricky to find.

*   **Q: What is the difference between "Draw 1" and "Draw 3" mode?**
    *   **A:** In "Draw 1" mode, you turn over one card at a time from the stock, which is generally easier. In "Draw 3" mode, you turn over three cards at a time, but you can only play the top card of the three, making the game significantly more challenging.

*   **Q: Can I play previous days' puzzles?**
    *   **A:** Many daily puzzle games feature a calendar, allowing you to go back and play puzzles from previous dates that you may have missed.
