### Detailed Game Introduction

Daily Word Climb is a clever and challenging word puzzle that provides a new brain-teaser every day. The goal is to unscramble a grid of letters to form correct words in each row. You do this by swapping letters one at a time. After each swap, the tiles change color to give you clues, helping you deduce the correct placement of each letter. With a limited number of moves, you must think strategically to solve the puzzle.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Understand the Color Clues:** The colors are your guide to solving the puzzle.
    *   **Green:** The letter is in the correct word and in its final, correct position.
    *   **Yellow:** The letter is in the word in that row, but it is currently in the wrong spot.
    *   **White/Grey:** The letter does not belong in that row's word at all.

2.  **Focus on Green Letters:** Once a letter turns green, you know it's locked in place. Don't move it again! Use the green letters as anchors to help you figure out the rest of the word.
3.  **Use Yellow Letters to Deduce:** If you have a yellow letter, you know it belongs in that same row, just in a different position. Look for other yellow or white tiles in that row to swap it with.
4.  **Conserve Your Moves:** You only have a limited number of swaps for each puzzle. Try to make each move count. Avoid random swaps and think about which swap will give you the most information.
