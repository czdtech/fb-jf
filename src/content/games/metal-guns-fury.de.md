### Detailed Game Introduction

Metal Guns Fury is a side‑scrolling run‑and‑gun in the spirit of arcade classics. Swap between rifles/shotguns/rockets, rescue hostages for power‑ups, and clear arenas packed with soldiers, turrets, and light vehicles. Clean jumps, slide‑dodges, and ammo discipline separate stable clears from messy deaths.
