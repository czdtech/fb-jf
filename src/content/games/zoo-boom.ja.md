### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Zoo Boom is a vibrant and engaging match-2 puzzle game that takes you on an exciting adventure through a colorful zoo. Your mission is to tap and blast groups of two or more identical animal blocks to clear them from the board. Each level presents unique challenges and objectives, such as collecting a certain number of specific animals, clearing obstacles, or reaching a target score within a limited number of moves. Unleash powerful boosters by matching larger groups of animals to create spectacular chain reactions and achieve high scores.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Look for Large Groups:** While you can match just two identical blocks, aim for larger groups of three or more. Matching more blocks at once will give you more points and help you create powerful boosters.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Combine Boosters:** The real power comes from combining two adjacent boosters. For example, combining two rockets can clear a huge area, while combining a bomb with a color-clearing item can be devastatingly effective.
