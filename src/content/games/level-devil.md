### Overview
Level Devil is a trick platformer where the stage betrays you—tiles crumble, spikes pop up mid‑jump, and exits move. Success demands cautious probing, reading visual tells, and memorizing trap locations rather than rushing.

### How to Play
- Nudge forward to trigger traps safely, then proceed.
- Watch for slight pixel differences that hint at fake floors or spikes.
- Checkpoints (when provided) reward measured progress.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; restart keys vary by host.

### Tips
- Don’t sprint blind; test ledges with short hops first.
- Expect traps near obvious “safe” tiles and exits.
- Count beats between moving hazards to time jumps.

### FAQ
- Q: How can I avoid sudden pop‑up spikes?  
  A: Trigger them with micro‑steps, retreat, then jump the safe path.
- Q: Why did the exit disappear in this level?  
  A: Many stages use fake exits; scan walls/floors for hidden doors.
- Q: Are there checkpoints to reduce repetition?  
  A: Some hosts include them; otherwise patience and routing are key.
