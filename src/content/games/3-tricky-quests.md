*Brain Test 3: Tricky Quests* is the third installment in the series from Unico Studio. While preserving the core "think outside the box" and "break the rules" puzzle-solving gameplay, this title introduces a significant evolution by incorporating stronger adventure and narrative elements, making it feel more like a puzzle-adventure game.

In the game, players take on the role of **Alyx**, who embarks on a journey to find six Power Gems to save her magically trapped father. Unlike the level-based structure of its predecessors, *Brain Test 3* features an interconnected game world and a complete, overarching storyline.

**Key Features:**

*   **Fusion of Adventure and Puzzles:** The game is no longer a linear sequence of levels. Players must explore different scenes, find items, and use them to solve puzzles that block their path.
*   **Inventory System:** This is the biggest new feature. Players can collect various items found in the environment and store them in Alyx's backpack. You need to figure out how to combine these items or apply them to specific scenarios at the right moment.
*   **Workshop System:** Alyx has a workshop where you can combine key quest items or upgrade your tools, preparing you for the adventures ahead.
*   **Interactive Dialogue:** The game introduces a dialogue choice system. By talking to NPCs (Non-Player Characters), you can obtain clues and advance the plot. Different choices can lead to different (and often humorous) outcomes.
*   **Classic Tricky Puzzles:** Despite the new systems, the heart of the game remains the same: tricky puzzles that require you to use your imagination and challenge conventional thinking. Classic interactions like dragging, shaking, and zooming are still key to finding solutions.

### **2. Game Walkthrough**

The strategy for *Brain Test 3* not only inherits the mindset of the previous games but also requires a greater focus on resource management and exploration.

*   **Core Principle: Explore and Collect**
    *   When entering a new area, don't rush to solve the immediate puzzle. First, carefully observe and tap on all suspicious objects to see what can be collected into your inventory.
*   **Master Your Inventory:**
    *   **Drag and Use:** When facing a challenge, open your backpack and try dragging items from it onto characters or objects in the scene.
    *   **Combine Items:** Sometimes, you need to drag two items onto each other within the inventory to craft a new, more useful tool.
    *   **Check All Items:** Don't forget what you're carrying. The key to the current puzzle might be an inconspicuous item you collected a long time ago.
*   **Pay Attention to Clues in Dialogue:**
    *   Read all conversations carefully. NPCs' words often directly or indirectly hint at what you need to do next or what item you should be looking for.
*   **Checklist for When You're Stuck:**
    1.  Have I interacted with every element in the scene? (Tapping, dragging, rubbing, etc.)
    2.  Is there an item in my backpack that I can use here?
    3.  Can I combine items in my backpack to create a new tool?
    4.  Do I need to return to a previous scene to find a missed item?
    5.  Did I miss any key information in the dialogue?
*   **The Hint System is Still Your Friend:**
    *   If all else fails, the built-in "light bulb" hint system is still available. It will point you toward the critical step or the required item, helping you overcome the obstacle.

### **4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q: How do I use the items in my backpack (inventory)?**
**A:** Tap the backpack icon at the bottom of the screen to open it. Then, press and hold the item you want to use and drag it to the target location in the game scene. To combine items, drag one item onto another within the inventory screen.

**Q: What is the fundamental difference between Brain Test 3 and the first two games?**
**A:** The main difference lies in the game structure. *Brain Test 1* is a collection of standalone puzzles. *Brain Test 2* introduced story-based chapters. *Brain Test 3* evolves into a full-fledged puzzle-adventure game with a complete main story, an inventory system, and an interconnected map, offering more freedom and continuity.

**Q: Why can't I get past a certain area?**
**A:** It's highly likely you are missing a key item. Try returning to previously visited scenes and search carefully for any collectible items you may have missed. Also, check if you can craft a new quest item in your workshop.

**Q: Is this game free?**
**A:** Yes, *Brain Test 3* is free to download and play, but it contains ads. You can watch ads to receive hints. The game also offers an in-app purchase to remove ads.

**Q: What is the Workshop for?**
**A:** The workshop is a crucial location for advancing the main plot. When you collect specific quest items (like fragments of a Power Gem), you need to return to the workshop to assemble them or to craft/upgrade special tools necessary for your progress.
