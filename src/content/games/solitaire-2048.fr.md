### Detailed Game Introduction

Solitaire 2048 converts merge logic into a card stream. You place cards (2, 4, 8…) into columns; adjacent equals merge to the next value. The trick is sequencing so merges cascade and free space rather than clog lanes.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Anchor column: Keep the highest value centralized for lateral access.
2.  **[FR]** Feeder management: Use side lanes to stage pairs before feeding center.
3.  **[FR]** Spike control: Flatten tall spikes first to avoid dead columns.
4.  **[FR]** Trigger timing: Drop the triggering card only after both neighbors are set.
5.  **[FR]** Trash lane: Dedicate one edge to off‑cycle cards.

### Controls Guide

- Click a column to place current card; undo/hints if available.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Columns keep locking.

A: Spread staging across two side lanes and avoid premature triggers.

- Q: Anchor corner or center?

A: Center yields more merge routes.

- Q: Can I recover from bad stacks?

A: Yes — flatten spikes and rebuild pairs before triggering.
