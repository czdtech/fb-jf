[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pirates Match 3 is a classic match-3 puzzle game with a swashbuckling pirate theme. Players dive into a world of treasure maps and pirate booty, swapping colorful, pirate-themed icons like skulls, anchors, ship wheels, and coins.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Focus on the Objective:** Always be aware of the level's goal. If you need to break all the wooden planks in the background, focus your matches on those specific tiles. If you need to drop an item to the bottom, clear the path beneath it.
