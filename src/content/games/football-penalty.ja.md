### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Football Penalty focuses on spot‑kicks. As the taker, you must select placement, height, and power while disguising intent. As the keeper (in some modes), you read the run‑up and dive accordingly. Clean corners, low drives, and late disguise beat average AI.
