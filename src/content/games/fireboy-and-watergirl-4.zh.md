### **Game Introduction**

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Fireboy and Watergirl 4: The Crystal Temple* is the fourth installment in the popular cooperative puzzle-platformer series. The game continues the core mechanics of its predecessors, requiring two players to guide the elemental duo through a series of intricate levels. Fireboy is immune to fire but must avoid water, while Watergirl is immune to water but must avoid fire. Both characters perish if they touch the green acid.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The unique and central mechanic of this installment is the **Crystal Portals**. These portals are scattered throughout each level and allow the characters to teleport from one location to another instantly. The portals add a significant layer of complexity to the puzzles.

*   **White Portals**: These are two-way portals. Entering a white-edged portal will transport you to the other corresponding white portal, and you can travel back and forth.
*   **Colored Portals (e.g., Black)**: These are one-way portals. You can only travel through them in one direction.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Successfully navigating the Crystal Temple requires players to understand how to use these portals to bypass obstacles, reach otherwise inaccessible areas, and coordinate their movements across different parts of the map.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

1.  **Master the Portals**: This is the most crucial skill for this game. Before moving, identify where each portal leads. Pay close attention to which ones are one-way, as entering one might trap a character until the other player can open a new path.
2.  **Momentum is Conserved**: When you enter a portal with speed, you will exit the corresponding portal with the same speed and in the same direction. Use this to your advantage to cross large gaps or reach high ledges immediately after teleporting.
3.  **Plan Your Route Through Portals**: Often, one character must go through a series of portals to activate a switch that allows the other character to proceed. Trace the path with your eyes before committing to a sequence of teleports.
4.  **Standard Co-op Rules Apply**: Communication remains vital. Coordinate who pushes boxes, who holds down buttons, and who flips levers. Many puzzles are impossible without precise, synchronized actions.
5.  **Look for Symmetrical Puzzles**: Many levels have a symmetrical design. What one character does on one side of the screen often needs to be mirrored by the other character on the opposite side, frequently using portals to assist each other.
6.  **Don't Rush One-Way Portals**: Think carefully before sending a character through a one-way portal. Ensure there is a way for them to either continue forward or for the other player to eventually open a path for them to return.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. How do the crystal portals work?**
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] They teleport your character instantly. Pay attention to the color of the portal's edge. White-edged portals are two-way (you can go back and forth). Other colored portals (like black) are one-way only. You will exit the portal that looks identical to the one you entered.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. Can I play this game alone?**
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Yes, but it is very difficult. You will need to control both characters at the same time, using both hands on different parts of the keyboard. The game is designed and best enjoyed with a partner.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. Why can't I finish the level even though I'm at the exit?**
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Both Fireboy and Watergirl must be standing at their respective, element-coded doors *simultaneously* for the level to end.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. What is the difference between this game and the other Fireboy and Watergirl games?**
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The main difference is the core puzzle mechanic. *The Forest Temple* (Part 1) is straightforward. *The Light Temple* (Part 2) introduced light beams and sensors. *The Ice Temple* (Part 3) added ice and snow physics. *The Crystal Temple* (Part 4) introduces the complex crystal portal system for teleportation.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **5. Are the gems necessary to complete a level?**
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] No, you do not need to collect any gems to finish a level. The gems are for achieving a higher score and rank. Collecting all gems and finishing quickly earns you the best grade.
