### Overview
Kingdom Rush established the series’ mix of lane control and hero micro. Build archer, barracks, mage, and artillery towers along path bends. Upgrade into specialized branches, call reinforcements to stall, and use hero actives and nukes to stabilize spikes. Enemy waves combine armor, magic resist, flyers, and spawn mechanics, demanding flexible builds.

### How to Play
- Anchor at choke points; support with splash and single‑target towers.
- Match towers to resistances; rotate hero to threatened lanes.
- Time global skills for boss phases and bursty waves.

### Controls
- Mouse/touch for all tower and hero actions; hotkeys vary.

### Tips
- Fewer, stronger towers outperform many weak ones early.
- Keep anti‑air coverage; flyers punish ground‑only setups.
- Use barracks to clump enemies under splash.

### FAQ
- Q: What is a good early game build order?  
  A: One barracks + one splash + one mage, then upgrade near the main choke.
- Q: How do I handle mixed waves effectively?  
  A: Combine mage (armor), archer/artillery (swarm), and position hero as finisher.
- Q: Are heroes required for completing levels?  
  A: Not mandatory, but they smooth spikes and save lives at choke points.
