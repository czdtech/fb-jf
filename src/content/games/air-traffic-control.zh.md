### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Air Traffic Control is a real‑time, puzzle‑like management game about sequencing arrivals and departures while maintaining safe separation. You select aircraft, issue vectors to build orderly downwind–base–final patterns, and sequence traffic so no two aircraft occupy the same space at the same time. The core loop is conflict detection and resolution: spot converging paths early, adjust headings and spacing, and feed aircraft to the runway at a steady, safe cadence.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  优先处理即将发生的冲突：首先解决最近的交叉路径；将非冲突流量推迟到局面稳定。
2.  提前规划间距：通过在合并前给出小的航向或路径差异来创建交错的最终进近；早期决策可以防止最后一秒的转弯。
3.  建立标准模式：使用一致的顺风→基础→最终流程；它简化了视觉扫描并减少了意外。
4.  如果可用，使用高度/速度：如果UI支持，小的速度降低或高度偏移可以在不进行大转弯的情况下增加间隔。
5.  保持跑道畅通：如果跑道仍被占用或飞机缓慢撤离，不要将另一架到达飞机送到短最终进近。
6.  避免过度引导：每次额外的转弯都会增加飞行员的工作量并增加新冲突的机会——更喜欢最小的、果断的引导。

### 控制指南

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Controls vary by version but commonly include:

- Select aircraft: Click or tap an aircraft label/target.
- Set path/heading: Click waypoints on the map or drag to draw a short path; some versions provide on‑screen heading buttons.
- Manage speed/altitude (if available): Use the UI arrows or buttons to make small adjustments; keep changes incremental.
- Assign runway/approach (if available): Choose a runway or approach fix when sequencing to final.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- How do I avoid collisions? Maintain horizontal separation by issuing early vectors; if available, combine gentle speed differences to open gaps.
- What does a conflict alert mean? It indicates predicted loss of separation; immediately adjust one or both aircraft to diverging headings.
- Can I pause or change speed? Many browser versions support pause or time controls; use them to plan sequences when the board is busy.
- Any tip for heavy traffic? Standardize the pattern and meter entries; resolve conflicts far from the runway so the final stays stable.
