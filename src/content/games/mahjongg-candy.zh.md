### Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mahjongg Candy is a sweet and engaging tile-matching puzzle game that puts a colorful, candy-themed spin on the classic Mahjongg Solitaire. The objective is to clear the entire board by finding and matching identical pairs of candy tiles. It's a game that tests your observation skills, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Matching Pairs:** Click or tap on two identical candy tiles to remove them from the board.
- **Unblocked Tiles:** Only tiles that are "unblocked" can be matched. An unblocked tile must have at least one free side (left or right) and no other tile on top of it.
- **Time Limit:** Most versions of the game have a time limit, so you need to think and act quickly.
- **Strategy:** Look for matches that will free up more tiles, especially those that are blocking other tiles. Don't just match the first pair you see.
- **Scoring:** Longer chains of matches or faster completion often lead to higher scores. Some tiles might offer score multipliers.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse/Touch:** Use your mouse or finger to click/tap on the tiles to select them.
