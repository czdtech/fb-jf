### Présentation

Identique dans l’idée à Tile Journey : clique sur des tuiles non couvertes

### Commandes

- **Identify Trapped Tiles:** Look for situations where one tile type is stacked directly on top of another of the same type. You will need to clear the top one first, which means you'll need to find its two other partners while the one below remains blocked.

- **Use the Tray as a Temporary Hold:** You can place tiles in the tray that don't yet form a match. Use this to your advantage. If you need a specific tile that is currently blocked, you can move other tiles into the tray to hold them while you work on freeing up the one you need.

- **Uncover New Tiles:** Your primary goal should be to make matches that uncover the most new tiles. Sometimes it's better to hold off on an easy match if it doesn't reveal any new, useful tiles underneath.

- **Think Before You Tap:** The collection tray has a very limited capacity (usually seven slots). Before you tap a tile, have a plan for it. Don't just tap random tiles hoping for the best.
