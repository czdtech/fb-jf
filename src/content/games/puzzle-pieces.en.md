### Detailed Game Introduction

Puzzle Pieces is a tidy shape‑fitting puzzler. Drag and rotate polyforms to fill boards exactly, managing limited space and piece orientations as layouts grow more intricate.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with anchors: Place unique or large shapes first to reduce ambiguity.
2.  Edge framing: Build clean borders to reveal interior gaps.
3.  Look for parity: Match protrusions and cavities; avoid leaving single‑cell holes.
4.  Rotate liberally: Check all orientations; many fits appear only after rotation.
5.  Undo freely: Backtrack early instead of forcing a bad fit.
