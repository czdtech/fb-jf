### Detailed Game Introduction

Dices 2048 3D is a physics‑infused take on the classic 2048 merging puzzle. Drop or slide dice so that identical face values collide and merge into the next value (e.g., 2→4→8). Gravity, bounce, and 3D placement create fresh tactics around stacking, spacing, and controlling accidental merges.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Keep lanes clean: Reserve a column for combining and another for staging; avoid cluttered piles that block merges.
2.  Chain reactions: Set up multiple adjacent pairs so one merge cascades into the next for big score swings.
3.  Value management: Don’t spawn a higher value in a corner with no neighbors; keep equal values within one move of contact.
4.  Tame physics: Soft drops and short nudges reduce unwanted bounces; let dice settle before committing the next piece.
5.  Bail‑out moves: When the board rises, clear space with safe merges rather than fishing for perfect chains.

### Controls Guide

- Aim/Place: Move cursor or drag to choose drop position; some versions allow rotation.
- Drop/Confirm: Click/tap to release the die.
- Undo/Retry (if available): Limited undos may exist; use them to rescue misdrops.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- How do dice merge? Identical values touching merge into the next value (e.g., two 8s become a 16).
- I keep causing accidental merges—how to stop? Reduce drop height, wait for full settle, and avoid diagonal ricochets.
- Is there an end? The game ends when no legal placements remain or the container overflows; aim to reach 2048 or beyond.
