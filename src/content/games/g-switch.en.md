<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Auto‑runner with gravity flips. Tap to invert gravity and land on the next surface while the pace accelerates.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Flip just before edges to clear gaps cleanly.
- Anticipate saws and walls; flip early rather than late.
- Endless and level modes may both be available.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- One key/`tap` to flip gravity; multiplayer maps separate keys per player.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Keep a steady flip rhythm; panic flips cause chain mistakes.
- Use long ceilings to reset timing safely.
- In multiplayer, watch opponents’ flips to pre‑empt traps.
