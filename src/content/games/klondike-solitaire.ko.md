### Overview
Klondike uses seven tableau columns, a stock, and four foundations. Build foundations up in‑suit from A to K. In the tableau, build down in alternating colors; only Kings (or King‑led stacks) may fill empty columns. Draw‑1 is more forgiving; draw‑3 requires cycle tracking.

### How to Play
- Expose facedown cards by moving stacks; start foundations with Aces.
- Keep one empty column for maneuvering complex rearrangements.
- In draw‑3, count the cycle to avoid locking key cards.

### Controls
- Drag‑and‑drop or tap; auto‑move enabled on many hosts.

### Tips
- Prefer moves that flip a facedown card.
- Don’t rush low cards to foundations if they help tableau moves.
- Move a King only when it frees space for a useful stack.

### FAQ
- Q: What can I place in an empty tableau column in this game?
A: Only a King or a stack headed by a King.
- Q: Should I always play cards to the foundation immediately?
A: Not always—keep them if they enable key tableau moves.
- Q: How does draw‑3 change strategy?
A: You must track the 3‑card order and plan multiple passes.
