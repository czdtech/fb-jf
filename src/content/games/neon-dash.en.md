### Detailed Game Introduction

Neon Dash is a reflex‑driven runner filled with spikes, platforms, and pulsing traps. Levels emphasize clean timing—short hops, late jumps, and consistent rhythm help you pass tight obstacle sequences. Expect checkpointed stages or one‑shot clears depending on the mode.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Learn jump arcs: Practice short/long taps to fine‑tune distance; late jumps often clear spikes more safely.
2.  Read patterns: Memorize trap cycles and attack them on consistent beats.
3.  Stay calm on chains: For multi‑obstacle chains, commit to the rhythm instead of second‑guessing mid‑air.
4.  Use sound cues: Music often maps to obstacles—let it guide your jump cadence.
5.  Drill tough sections: Restart and isolate the hardest segment to build muscle memory.
