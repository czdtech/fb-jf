<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Idle Breakout merges incremental progression with classic brick‑breaking. Early on you click to deal damage; soon you purchase balls with differing speed, damage, and special effects, plus automated launchers. Bricks scale health, bosses appear periodically, and prestige resets grant permanent multipliers that accelerate future runs.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Invest early in cheap balls for constant DPS; add specials (sniper, scatter) later.
- Target upgrade breakpoints that double DPS rather than small steps.
- Prestige when progress stalls; compounding multipliers matter most.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Mouse`: `click` to damage; UI to buy balls, upgrades, and prestige nodes.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Keep at least one high‑damage ball to burst bosses.
- Idle efficiency rises with automation; check in to re‑allocate spending.
- Use offline time multipliers if your host supports them.

### FAQ
- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:idle-breakout:when-should-i-trigger-a-d8a2ff2f -->
  Q: When should I trigger a prestige reset?
  A: When your brick clears slow to a crawl; earlier resets often yield faster long‑term growth.

  Q: Which ball types are best early in the game?
