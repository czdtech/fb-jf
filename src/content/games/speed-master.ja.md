### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Speed Master is a minimalist reaction game that pushes timing and focus. Prompts sweep across the screen; you must tap at the exact overlap window. Difficulty rises with faster sweeps, deceptive rhythms, and multi‑lane inputs that punish early flinches and late presses alike.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Beat counting: Lock to a steady internal count; tap to beat rather than pure sight.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Peripheral prediction: Track the next prompt while executing the current one.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Late‑bias safety: Slightly late taps are safer than early (most engines accept late end‑frames).
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Two‑lane focus: Keep eyes between lanes; don’t hard‑fixate on one side.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Regain cadence: After a miss, breathe, realign posture, then continue.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/press when prompts reach markers; multi‑lane binds use arrow/WASD (varies). Pause/Retry via UI.
