### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Create Special Gems:** The key to success is to think beyond simple match-3s. Always be on the lookout for opportunities to create powerful special gems:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Match 4 Gems:** Creates a Lightning Jewel that clears an entire row or column.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Match 5 Gems (L or T Shape):** Creates a Bomb Jewel that explodes, destroying all surrounding gems.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Match 5 Gems (in a line):** Creates a powerful Color Jewel that can clear all gems of a single color from the board.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Combine Boosters for Maximum Impact:** Don't just use your special gems; combine them! Swapping two special gems next to each other results in a massive board-clearing effect. For example, swapping a Bomb with a Lightning Jewel clears three rows/columns, and swapping two Color Jewels clears every single gem on the board.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Plan Your Moves:** You only have a limited number of moves for each level. Before making a swap, look at the entire board and the level objective. Prioritize matches that will help you achieve the goal, such as breaking frozen tiles or dropping special items.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Anticipate Cascades:** Making matches at the bottom of the board is often a good strategy. This allows a large number of new gems to fall into place, increasing the chance of setting off a chain reaction (cascade) of automatic matches, which can clear a large portion of the board without using any extra moves.
