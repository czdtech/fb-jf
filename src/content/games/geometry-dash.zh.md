[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Forget the fluff. This isn't your standard Geometry Dash stroll. This is a pure, uncut, wave-only gauntlet designed to break you and build you back stronger. We've stripped out the portals, the pads, and the coins—it's just you, your ship, and a pixel-perfect corridor of death.
 
### MASTER THE WAVE OR DIE TRYING
 
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] This is the ultimate training ground. A brutalist trial by fire where your muscle memory and rhythmic precision are the only things that matter. The corridors are tight, the spikes are unforgiving, and a single mistimed tap means instant failure. No luck, no shortcuts—just raw, unfiltered skill.
 
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] If you can't handle the pressure, you won't last a second. But if you're here to truly master the wave, to sharpen your reflexes until they're razor-edged, then this is your arena. Every run is a high-octane lesson in control.
 
#### Features:
 
- Pure Wave Gameplay: Nothing but the wave form. This is the ultimate test of your core mechanics.
- Pixel-Perfect Corridors: Navigate spike tunnels so tight they demand flawless control. One pixel can be the difference between glory and another reset.
- Brutal, High-Intensity Runs: This level is designed for quick, explosive attempts. Learn, adapt, and go again—faster and sharper each time.
