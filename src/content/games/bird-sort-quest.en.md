### Detailed Game Introduction

Bird Sort Quest is a calm logic puzzle in the family of liquid/sort games. Each perch holds a stack of colorful birds. Move one bird at a time so that every perch ends up with birds of a single color. The challenge comes from limited free perches and the rule that only a matching color (or empty slot) can accept a moved bird, forcing you to plan buffers and temporary parking.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Reserve buffers: Keep at least one empty perch as a flexible buffer for shuffling.
2.  Build from bottom: Stabilize stacks by finishing a color on a dedicated perch starting from the bottom.
3.  Avoid burying singles: Don’t trap unique colors under mixed stacks; surface them early.
4.  Two‑move foresight: Before moving, simulate the next two placements to avoid softlocks.
5.  Consolidate mid‑game: Merge partial stacks of the same color as soon as feasible to free perches.
6.  Backtrack quickly: If a move increases disorder, undo and try a different route while buffers are intact.

### Controls Guide

- Select a perch to pick the top bird, then select the destination perch.
- Undo/Reset if the mode offers it; hints are best saved for late puzzles.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I’m stuck with no legal moves — what should I do?
  
  A: Backtrack a few moves and reopen a buffer perch. Prioritize surfacing buried singles to create new legal placements.

- Q: Is there a guaranteed strategy for every level?
  
  A: Not always, but maintaining at least one buffer and consolidating partial stacks early solves most layouts.

- Q: Should I finish one color completely before touching others?
  
  A: It’s efficient to lock in a finished color when convenient, but don’t force it if it consumes all buffers.

- Q: Are extra perches ever added?
  
  A: Some sets introduce bonus perches on tougher stages—use them as temporary parking to simplify.

- Q: Do move counts matter?
  
  A: In some modes yes; aim for minimal moves by reducing unnecessary shuffles.
