### Detailed Game Introduction

Hoop Stars is a rapid ring‑flip contest. You rotate a ring around a central peg and flip it to land past obstacles. Clean flips that settle over the peg score; misses costs time. Duels reward consistent timing and smart angle setups more than raw speed.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Pre‑spin: Rotate to a comfortable angle before flipping.
2.  Early/late windows: Learn how early vs late flips change arc height.
3.  Obstacle reads: Wait half a cycle for gaps; don’t force throws.
4.  Mind rebounds: If a ring bounces, don’t re‑flip into chaos — reset.
5.  PvP: Bait opponents by faking flips, then land a clean one.

### Controls Guide

- Hold to spin; release to flip; some builds use two buttons for spin vs flip.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

  A: Adjust release timing earlier/later and reduce pre‑spin speed for steadier arcs.

- Q: Is button mashing viable?
  
  A: Not really — consistent setups beat spam.

- Q: Local multiplayer?
  
  A: Often available with mirrored controls.
