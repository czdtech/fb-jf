### Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] "There is no game" is a unique and highly acclaimed meta-puzzle adventure game that constantly challenges the player's perception of what a game is. Guided (or rather, misguided) by a sarcastic narrator who insists there is no game to play, players must find unconventional ways to interact with the environment, break the rules, and progress through a series of clever and humorous puzzles.

### Gameplay Guide

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The core gameplay involves point-and-click interactions. You'll need to click, drag, and manipulate elements on the screen in unexpected ways to solve puzzles and advance. The game frequently breaks the fourth wall, and success often requires thinking outside the box and ignoring the narrator's direct instructions. Each "level" presents a new scenario where you must figure out how to bypass the narrator's attempts to stop you from playing.

### Controls Guide

- **Left Mouse Button:** Used for all interactions, including clicking on objects, dragging elements, and solving puzzles.
