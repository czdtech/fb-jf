### Overview
Love Tester is a lighthearted name‑matching toy. You input two names and receive a whimsical “compatibility” percentage with occasional messages or animations. It’s purely for fun—results are random or based on simple hashing and do not represent real compatibility.

### How to Play
- Enter two names (or any words) and press test.
- Share results or rerun with different inputs for laughs.

### Controls
- Keyboard input and a single test button.

### Tips
- Use creative prompts (nicknames, team names) to vary outputs.
- Treat results as a joke, not advice.

### FAQ
- Q: Is the compatibility score scientifically accurate?
A: No, it is for entertainment only.
- Q: Can I save or share the results?
A: Some hosts include share buttons or screenshots.
- Q: Do spaces or punctuation matter in names?
A: Behavior varies; stick to letters for consistent outputs.
