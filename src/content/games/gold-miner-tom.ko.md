### Detailed Game Introduction

Gold Miner Tom is a classic arcade-style game that tests your timing and precision. As the ambitious miner Tom, you control a swinging claw and must cast it at the right moment to grab valuable treasures buried underground. Each level has a specific monetary goal you must reach within a time limit. Grab gold nuggets, sparkling diamonds, and mysterious goodie bags, but be careful to avoid worthless rocks that will waste your precious time!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Timing is Everything:** The claw swings back and forth continuously. Your success depends entirely on clicking at the perfect moment to send the claw in the direction of a valuable item.
2.  **[KO]** **Know Your Treasure:** Different items have different values and weights.
    *   **[KO]** **Large Gold Nuggets & Diamonds:** These are your primary targets. They are worth the most money.
    *   **[KO]** **Small Gold Nuggets:** Easier to grab and faster to reel in, but less valuable.
    *   **[KO]** **Rocks:** Avoid these! They are worth very little money and are very heavy, meaning they take a long time to reel in, wasting valuable time.
    *   **[KO]** **Mystery Bags:** These contain a random amount of money or a power-up.
3.  **[KO]** **Shop Between Levels:** Use the money you've earned to buy helpful items in the shop between levels. Dynamite is essential for blowing up worthless rocks you accidentally grab. Strength potions help you reel in heavy objects faster.

### Controls Guide

The game uses a simple, one-touch control scheme.

*   **[KO]** **Cast Claw:** Click your mouse or tap the screen to launch the claw in its current direction.
*   **[KO]** **Use Dynamite:** If you have dynamite and have grabbed an object, a dynamite button will appear. Click it to destroy the object on your claw.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

    *   **[KO]** **A:** If the timer runs out and you haven't met the goal, the game is over.
