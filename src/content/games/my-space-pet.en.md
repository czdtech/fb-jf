### Detailed Game Introduction

My Space Pet invites you to adopt and care for an adorable alien creature named Zuub. This charming virtual pet game combines elements of nurturing, mini-games, and customization. Your mission is to keep Zuub happy and healthy by fulfilling its basic needs: feeding it when hungry, washing it when dirty, and ensuring it gets enough rest. Beyond basic care, you can play engaging mini-games to earn coins, which can then be used to unlock a variety of stylish outfits and accessories to personalize your space pet.
