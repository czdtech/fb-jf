### Detailed Game Introduction

Penalty Showdown alternates between shooting and goalkeeping phases. As the taker, disguise placement and height; as the keeper, read run‑ups and dive late. Winning relies on rhythm changes and mixed shot profiles rather than power alone.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Mix profiles: Alternate low corners, high corners, and center chips to avoid patterns.
2.  Keeper late dive: Move briefly then commit late to the striker’s open‑body side.
3.  Power windows: Mid‑high power gives speed without wild slices.
4.  Wind: Offset aim and reduce height under strong wind (if modeled).
5.  Mind games: Pause a beat before shots to bait early dives.

### Controls Guide

- Shoot: aim + power + (optional) swerve. Keep: choose side/timing; some builds allow manual dives.
