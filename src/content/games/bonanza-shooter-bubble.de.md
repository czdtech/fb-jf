### Detailed Game Introduction

Bonanza Shooter Bubble is a classic bubble shooter with generous banking and satisfying drops. Aim and fire to connect three or more of the same color, clearing clusters and causing dangling groups to fall. Success hinges on angle control, color management, and planning for the next bubble.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Bank shots: Use side‑wall bounces to reach tucked clusters.
2.  **[DE]** Cut anchors: Remove the single connecting bubble to drop an entire hanging group.
3.  **[DE]** Color economy: Avoid burying rare colors; prioritize shots that unlock multiple paths.
4.  **[DE]** Look‑ahead: If next bubble is shown, pre‑plan two moves to avoid blocking lanes.
5.  **[DE]** Pace control: When the ceiling lowers, favor safe clears over greedy snipes.

### Controls Guide

- Aim with mouse/touch and click/tap to fire; swap bubbles if the mode allows.
- Pause/Restart via UI.
