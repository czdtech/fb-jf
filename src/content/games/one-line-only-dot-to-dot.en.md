### Detailed Game Introduction

One line only: dot to dot follows the Euler path tradition: connect all points/edges with a single, unbroken stroke. Boards introduce bridges, forced turns, and parity tricks that require careful route planning and backtracking discipline.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Degree count: Start at odd‑degree nodes (0 or 2 exist for Euler trails); they suggest endpoints.
2.  Bridge first: Draw mandatory bridges early so you don’t lock them out later.
3.  Avoid isolating: Don’t complete loops that strand unvisited edges.
4.  Look‑ahead: Test two moves mentally; backtrack early when isolation appears.
5.  Symmetry: Use symmetrical halves to mirror partial routes.

### Controls Guide

- `Drag` to draw along segments; undo/clear via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:one-line-only-dot-to-dot:i-end-one-step-short-2ba592fd -->
  Q: I end one step short — why?
  
  A: You likely started at a wrong endpoint; try an odd‑degree node instead.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:one-line-only-dot-to-dot:are-crossings-allowed-127ec18f -->
  Q: Are crossings allowed?
  
  A: Only along provided segments; no freehand crossings.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:one-line-only-dot-to-dot:any-hint-system-83b1a6f0 -->
  Q: Any hint system?
  
  A: Many builds provide hints or highlight bridges.
