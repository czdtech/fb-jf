### Detailed Game Introduction

Minesweeper is a classic single-player logic puzzle that has been a staple of personal computing for decades. The objective is to clear a rectangular grid containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them. To do this, you use clues from revealed squares that tell you how many mines are in the adjacent eight squares. It's a game of pure deduction and careful risk assessment.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The First Click:** Your first click is always safe. If you click a square that has no adjacent mines, it will open a large area, which is a great start.
2.  **Understanding the Numbers:** The number on a revealed square tells you exactly how many mines are in the eight squares touching it (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). This is the only information you have to work with.
3.  **The 1-2-1 Pattern:** A common and easy pattern to spot. If you see a "1-2-1" in a line, you know for certain that the squares next to the '1's are mines, and the square next to the '2' (on the other side) is safe.
4.  **Flag Your Mines:** When you are 100% certain a square contains a mine, right-click to "flag" it. This prevents you from accidentally clicking on it later and helps you keep track of where the dangers are.
5.  **Chord-Clicking:** If a numbered square already has the correct number of flags touching it, you can click on the number itself (or often middle-click/left+right click) to automatically reveal all its other adjacent, un-flagged squares. This is a fast way to clear the board but be careful—if your flags are wrong, you will detonate a mine!
