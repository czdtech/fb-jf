### Detailed Game Introduction

3D Free Kick focuses on set‑piece mastery: pick a target, curve around the wall, and beat the keeper. Stages vary wall size, keeper reactions, distance, and wind to test precision and shot shaping.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Target corners: High/low corners are hardest to reach for keepers.
2.  Add controlled curve: Apply just enough spin to clear the wall and dip inside the post.
3.  Read wind: Offset your aim and spin according to wind direction/strength (if present).
4.  Mix heights: Flat drives for close range; dipping shots for longer walls.
5.  Learn keeper tells: Some keepers step early—fake lines and bend late.

### Controls Guide

- Aim: Drag to set direction and height.
- Power: Control swipe length/hold duration.
- Curve: Swipe curve or adjust spin slider to apply sidespin/topspin.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- My shots hit the wall—how to fix? Start wider and add a bit more curve; or raise trajectory slightly.
- Keeper keeps catching—tips? Aim for far post with late curl; vary height to break patterns.
- Does wind matter? Yes—counter it with opposite‑direction curve and offset aim.
