### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mazes offers a suite of labyrinths from simple grids to trap‑laden gauntlets. The challenge is route planning: finding shortest safe paths, avoiding trap tiles, and hitting switches to open gates while staying under par times.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Right/left‑hand rules: Use wall‑following on simply connected mazes; abandon on multi‑loops.
