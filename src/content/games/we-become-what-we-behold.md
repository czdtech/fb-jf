### Game Introduction

"We Become What We Behold" is a short, satirical point-and-click game by Nicky Case that offers a sharp commentary on media, sensationalism, and how our focus on negativity can amplify societal divisions. The game challenges players to observe a small world of characters and decide what "news" to capture with their camera, directly influencing the narrative and the characters' behavior.

### Gameplay Guide

The core gameplay involves observing the screen and using your camera to photograph events.
- **Observe:** Watch the characters (squares and circles) interact.
- **Capture:** Click to take a photo of a "news" event. Your choice of what to photograph directly impacts what appears on the in-game TV screen, which in turn influences the characters' reactions.
- **Consequences:** The game subtly demonstrates how focusing on controversial or shocking content can lead to a cycle of anger, fear, and division. There's no explicit win condition; the game typically ends with a dramatic climax reflecting the consequences of media sensationalism.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse:** Use your mouse to aim the camera and click to take a photograph.
