### Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] "PAC-MAN" is a classic arcade maze game. Players control the yellow Pac-Man, moving through a complex labyrinth with the objective of eating all the pellets. Simultaneously, players must evade four colorful ghosts—Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde. When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, he can temporarily turn the tables and pursue and eat the ghosts for extra points.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Understand Ghost Behavior**: Each ghost has its unique AI pattern. Blinky (red) is a chaser, Pinky (pink) tries to ambush, Inky (light blue) has more complex movements, and Clyde (orange) tends to wander randomly.
2.  **Utilize Power Pellets**: After eating a power pellet, immediately chase and eat the ghosts for high scores. The more ghosts eaten, the higher the score.
3.  **Plan Routes**: When moving through the maze, plan your route in advance to avoid being cornered by ghosts.
4.  **Use Tunnels**: The tunnels at both ends of the maze allow Pac-Man to quickly move from one side to the other, useful for evading or counter-attacking ghosts.
5.  **Prioritize Large Pellets**: Power pellets (large pellets) are crucial for turning the tide and should be prioritized.

### How to Play

*   **Movement**: Typically use the keyboard arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control Pac-Man's movement direction in the maze.
