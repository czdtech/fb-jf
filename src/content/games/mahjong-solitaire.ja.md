[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mahjong Solitaire is a single-player matching game that uses a set of Mahjong tiles.

The tiles are arranged in various layouts, often in multi-layered stacks. The game requires careful observation, strategy, and planning, as one wrong move can block future matches. It's a relaxing yet mentally stimulating puzzle enjoyed by millions.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Understanding "Free" Tiles:** The most important rule is that you can only select and match "free" (or "open") tiles. A tile is considered free if:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   It has no other tiles on top of it.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   It can be slid out to the left or the right without bumping into another tile.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Prioritize Unblocking:** Your main strategy should be to make matches that unblock the most new tiles. Look for pairs that are sitting on top of other columns or are blocking multiple tiles horizontally.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Handle Triplets and Quads Carefully:** If you see three or four identical free tiles, be strategic about which pair you match. Choose the pair that will open up the most advantageous section of the board for future moves.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Special Tiles (Seasons and Flowers):** In most versions, the Season and Flower tiles are exceptions to the identical match rule. Any Season tile can be matched with any other Season tile. The same applies to Flower tiles. These can be very useful for unblocking the board when no other matches are available.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Use Hints and Shuffles Wisely:** If you are stuck, use the "Hint" button to reveal an available pair. If there are no more possible matches on the board, the game may offer a "Shuffle" option, which rearranges all remaining tiles to create new matching opportunities.
