### Game Introduction

Bubble Shooter is a classic and highly addictive puzzle game. The objective is to clear the playing field by forming groups of three or more same-colored bubbles. The game screen is filled with a grid of colorful bubbles from the top. The player controls a launcher at the bottom of the screen, which shoots a single bubble upwards.

The core mechanic is simple: when the launched bubble hits a group of two or more bubbles of the same color, the entire connected group of matching bubbles is removed from the screen. Any bubbles that were attached only to the cleared group will also fall and be removed. The goal is to clear all the bubbles from the screen to win the level or achieve the highest possible score before the bubbles descend to the bottom line. After a certain number of shots without clearing any bubbles, a new row of bubbles is added at the top, increasing the pressure and challenge.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Aim for the Highest Bubbles:** The single most important strategy is not just to make matches, but to make matches that are high up on the screen. If you clear a group of bubbles that is supporting other bubbles below it, all the unsupported bubbles will fall. Dropping large clusters this way is the key to high scores and efficient clearing.
-   **Use the Walls (Bank Shots):** Don't always aim directly. You can shoot the bubble against the side walls to make it bounce and reach difficult spots. Mastering these "bank shots" is essential for advanced play and for getting out of tricky situations.
-   **Plan Ahead:** Most versions of the game show you the color of the *next* bubble in your launcher. Use this information to plan your next two moves. Sometimes, it's better to make a less optimal move now to set up a perfect shot with the next bubble.
-   **Don't Create Single-Bubble Strands:** Try to avoid leaving a single bubble of a certain color hanging by itself. These can be very difficult to remove later, as you'll need to clear the bubbles around it or get two more of the same color to stick to it.
-   **Manage Difficult Colors:** If you get a bubble color that has no immediate good match, don't just waste the shot. Try to tuck it away next to a large group of another color where it won't block important future shots.

### Controls Guide

The controls are extremely simple and intuitive, designed for mouse or touch.

-   **Aim:** Move your **mouse cursor** to aim the launcher's arrow.
-   **Shoot:** **Left-click** with your mouse to shoot the bubble.
-   **Swap Bubbles (in some versions):** Some modern versions allow you to press a key (like the **Spacebar**) or click an icon to swap the current bubble with the next one in the queue.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is the goal of the game?**
> In most classic versions, the goal is to clear the entire screen of bubbles. In endless modes, the goal is to survive as long as possible and get the highest score.

**2. What happens if I miss a shot?**
> A "miss" is typically defined as a shot that does not result in any bubbles being cleared. After a set number of misses (often shown as a counter of bubbles at the bottom), a new row of bubbles will be added to the top of the screen, pushing everything down.

**3. Are there special bubbles or power-ups?**
> In the classic, original version of Bubble Shooter, there are no special bubbles. However, many modern variations have introduced power-ups like **Bomb Bubbles** (clear an area), **Rainbow Bubbles** (match any color), and **Fireball Bubbles** (destroy everything in their path).

**4. What is the best strategy for getting a high score?**
> The best way to get a high score is to drop large clusters of bubbles at once. The more bubbles you drop that were not part of the direct match, the more bonus points you receive. Focus on making high-up bank shots to achieve this.
