### Overview
Google’s playful baseball doodle casts you as a batter facing varied pitches. Timing and placement determine singles, doubles, and home runs, while comedic fielders try to catch fly balls. There’s no fielding—focus purely on batting consistency and shot selection.

### How to Play
- Watch the pitcher’s wind‑up and ball speed; swing when it crosses the plate.
- Aim to pull or push based on timing; late swings send to opposite field.
- Avoid pop‑ups; line drives find gaps more reliably.

### Controls
- Tap/Click/Space to swing.

### Tips
- Don’t pre‑swing—react to release and location.
- Slightly late contact often yields opposite‑field hits past infielders.
- Reset rhythm after a miss; rushing compounds errors.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I hit consistent home runs?  
  A: Meet the ball slightly out front at belt height; too high becomes an easy catch.
- Q: Does pitch speed change during play?  
  A: Yes, speeds vary; adjust your trigger point.
- Q: Is progress saved?  
  A: Scores are typically local to the session.
