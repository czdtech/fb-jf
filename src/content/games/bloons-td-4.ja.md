### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bloons TD 4 represents a significant evolution in the Bloons Tower Defense series, introducing a major graphical overhaul and foundational gameplay mechanics that defined future titles. While the core objective—placing monkeys to pop waves of Bloons—remains, BTD4 deepened the strategy immensely.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The most important innovation in this installment is the introduction of **branching upgrade paths**. Instead of buying all available upgrades for a tower, players must make a strategic choice between two powerful, mutually exclusive tier 3 and tier 4 upgrades. This creates diverse roles for the same tower.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game also introduced a **player rank system**. By playing and completing games, players earn experience points (XP) to level up their rank. New towers, upgrades, and game modes are unlocked as the player's rank increases, adding a persistent sense of progression.

- **Powerful アップグレード Paths to Aim For:**

    - **Monkey Glue (2/2 - Bloon Dissolver):** Excellent for slowing down blimps and melting through ceramic layers.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Banana Farms are a Must:** For higher difficulties and late-game survival, you need an economy. 構築する Banana Farms early and upgrade them to `Banana Republic` (2/x) to generate a steady income stream. This allows you to afford expensive tier 4 upgrades and Super Monkeys.
-   **Branching Upgrades:** The cornerstone of modern Bloons TD strategy. For example, a Tack Shooter can be upgraded to a `Tack Sprayer` for more tacks or a `Ring of Fire` for powerful AoE damage, but not both.
- **How to Beat the BFB:** The BFB (first appears on Round 65) is a huge threat. Your defense should include:（日本語訳が必要）

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Why can't I buy a certain tower or upgrade?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > In Bloons TD 4, most towers and all tier 3 and 4 upgrades must be unlocked by increasing your player rank. Play more games to earn XP and you will eventually unlock everything.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. How do I pop Camo Bloons?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > You need towers with camo detection. This includes Dart Monkeys with the `Enhanced Eyesight` (2/2) upgrade, Mortar Towers with the `Signal Flare` (x/3) upgrade, or Spike Factories with the `Bigger Stacks` (1/x) upgrade.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. What's the difference between the blue MOAB and the red BFB?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > The BFB (Brutal Flying Behemoth) is much stronger and more durable than the MOAB. When a BFB is popped, it releases four MOABs.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. Can I buy all the upgrades for one monkey?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > No. This is the biggest change in BTD4. You can only choose one of the two final upgrade paths for each tower. For example, you can get a Super Monkey's `Sun God` (2/x) OR `Robo-Monkey` (x/2), but not both on the same tower.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **5. What is Apopalypse Mode?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > It's a special game mode where Bloons come in continuous, overlapping waves without any breaks between rounds. You don't earn money at the end of rounds, only from popping Bloons, making it very challenging.
