### Overview
Head Soccer condenses football to punchy 1v1 duels with oversized heads and simple physics. Matches last seconds to minutes; power‑ups and special shots create swing moments. Win by outscoring within the timer or golden‑goal rules.

### How to Play
- Position under lobs for headers; volley low balls for speed.
- Trigger specials when the goal is open; block with timely jumps.
- In two‑player, divide roles—pressure vs. coverage.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD to move/jump; shoot/special keys vary by host.

### Tips
- Early jump + tap shot produces fast low drives.
- Save specials for counterattacks or rebounds.
- Defensively, stand slightly off‑line to angle clearances.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I score more consistently in this game?  
  A: Use jump‑timed headers/volleys and shoot low into corners.
- Q: Does the game support two players on one device?  
  A: Many hosts include local 2P with separate key binds.
- Q: Are there team or character differences?  
  A: Often cosmetic; physics are generally uniform across skins.
