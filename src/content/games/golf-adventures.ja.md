### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Golf Adventures is a fun and imaginative puzzle game that uses the mechanics of golf. Instead of a realistic golf course, you'll find yourself in a series of creative and challenging levels filled with unique obstacles. The goal is simple: get the ball into the hole in as few strokes as possible. It's a game of angles, power, and clever problem-solving.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Plan Your Shot:** Before you shoot, take a look at the entire level. Observe the obstacles, the slopes, and the position of the hole. The shortest path is not always the best one.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Master the Power:** The distance you pull back determines the power of your shot. Getting a feel for how much power is needed for different distances is key. Start with gentle shots until you get a feel for the physics.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Use the Environment:** Many levels are designed for you to use the walls and obstacles to your advantage. Bouncing the ball off a wall (a "bank shot") might be the only way to get around an obstacle and close to the hole.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Aim for Par or Better:** Each hole has a "Par," which is the target number of strokes for a skilled player. Your goal is to meet or beat par (a "Birdie" is one under par, an "Eagle" is two under).
