### Game Introduction

"Mini Crossword" is a compact daily crossword puzzle game. It offers a small yet challenging grid where players need to fill in the correct words based on the provided clues to complete the entire crossword. This game is suitable for quick sessions, both expanding vocabulary and providing puzzle-solving enjoyment.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Understand Clues**: Carefully read both the across and down clues; they are key to solving the puzzle.
2.  **Start with Known Information**: Fill in words you are confident about first; their letters will help you deduce other words.
3.  **Utilize Intersecting Clues**: When some letters of a word are determined by other words, use these letters to guess and confirm the word.
4.  **Gradually Narrow Down**: For uncertain words, you can first fill in the letters you know, then deduce based on the remaining blanks and clues.

*   **Enter Letters**: Use the keyboard to input letters.
*   **Clear Letters**: Use the backspace key to delete entered letters.
*   **View Clues**: The game interface usually displays clue information for the currently selected word.
