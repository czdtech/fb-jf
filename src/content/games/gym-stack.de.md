### Detailed Game Introduction

Gym Stack is an addictive and satisfying 3D puzzle game that challenges your organizational skills. The game board features several bars where different colored and sized weights will appear. Your objective is to strategically move and stack these weights, merging identical ones to create larger weights and clear space. The goal is to score as many points as possible by making smart merges without letting the bars get completely filled up. It's a test of foresight and strategy with a fun gym theme.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Match by Color:** You can only merge weights that are of the same color. Plan your moves to bring identical weights together.
2.  **[DE]** **Think Vertically:** You need to stack smaller weights on top of larger ones of the same color to merge them. You cannot place a larger weight on top of a smaller one.
3.  **[DE]** **Keep Columns Open:** Try not to block access to other columns. A poorly placed weight can prevent you from making crucial merges later on. Keep your stacks organized.
4.  **[DE]** **Plan for a Cascade:** Sometimes, a single move can set off a chain reaction of merges. Look for these opportunities to clear a large amount of space and score big points.
5.  **[DE]** **Don't Get Trapped:** The game ends if the bars fill up and you have no more legal moves. Always be thinking about how to keep space available for new weights that will appear.
