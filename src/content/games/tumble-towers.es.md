### Detailed Game Introduction

Tumble Towers is a stacker where each drop changes center of mass. Good play distributes weight, limits overhangs, and anticipates sway so the tower survives post‑drop jiggles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** Wide bases beat height rushes.
2.  **[ES]** Stagger seams; avoid vertical seam lines.
3.  **[ES]** Counter‑weights: Place small blocks opposite overhangs.
4.  **[ES]** Pause between drops; let sway settle.
5.  **[ES]** Trim tops with small pieces for fine leveling.

### Controls Guide

- Aim and drop; rotate if allowed; restart via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Tower keeps swaying apart.

A: You’re dropping too fast or stacking seam‑on‑seam; stagger and pause.

- Q: Can I salvage a lean?

A: Counter‑weight on the high side and shorten overhangs.
