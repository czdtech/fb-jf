### Detailed Game Introduction

Pool 8 Ball Mania simulates casual 8‑ball with responsive aiming and spin. The core is cue‑ball control: land shape for the next shot, use topspin to follow, backspin to draw, and sidespin off rails to manage lines.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Pre‑plan shape: Decide landing spots before every pot.
2.  Speed first: Smooth medium strokes trump power slams.
3.  Spin sparing: Small top/back/side spin corrections are safer.
4.  Pattern clears: Resolve clusters and problem balls early.
5.  Safety: If the pot is thin and risky, play safe to leave the opponent tough.

### Controls Guide

- Aim: drag; Power: pull meter; Spin: adjust cue‑ball diagram; Camera: pan/zoom if available.
