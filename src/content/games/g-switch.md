### Overview
Auto‑runner with gravity flips. Tap to invert gravity and land on the next surface while the pace accelerates.

### How to Play
- Flip just before edges to clear gaps cleanly.
- Anticipate saws and walls; flip early rather than late.
- Endless and level modes may both be available.

### Controls
- One key/tap to flip gravity; multiplayer maps separate keys per player.

### Tips
- Keep a steady flip rhythm; panic flips cause chain mistakes.
- Use long ceilings to reset timing safely.
- In multiplayer, watch opponents’ flips to pre‑empt traps.

### FAQ
- Q: Why do I miss short platforms?  
  A: You are flipping too late; flip slightly before the edge.
- Q: Does the game support multiplayer?  
  A: Many versions include local multiplayer with multiple keys.
- Q: Are level layouts fixed?  
  A: Some modes are authored levels; endless modes are often procedural.
