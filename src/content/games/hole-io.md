### Overview
Hole io drops you into a destructible city as a roaming black hole. Start by eating small items—cones, benches, people—then graduate to cars, buildings, and entire blocks as your size increases. Modes include free‑for‑all score chases and battle variants where you knock out opponents by swallowing them.

### How to Play
- Target clusters of small objects first for rapid growth.
- Path through parks/markets early, then move to car‑dense streets.
- When large, circle buildings to break them into swallowable pieces.

### Controls
- Mouse/drag or WASD to steer; modes and timers vary by host.

### Tips
- Avoid larger rivals until you’ve grown; escape down wide streets.
- Plan a growth route; detours waste precious timer seconds.
- Use corners to trap opponents once you outsize them.

### FAQ
- Q: How can I grow quickly at the start of the match?  
  A: Prioritize dense clusters of tiny items before chasing cars or buildings.
- Q: Can bigger holes eat me in this game?  
  A: Yes—avoid direct paths and stay in open lanes until you grow.
- Q: What mode should I pick for learning?  
  A: FFA score mode is forgiving; practice routes without constant PvP.
