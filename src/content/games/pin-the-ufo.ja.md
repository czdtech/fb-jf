### **Game Introduction**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Pin the UFO* is a charming and strategic "pull the pin" puzzle game set in outer space. The primary objective is to **safely guide a group of colorful alien "cubs" into their UFO spaceship at the bottom of the screen.**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Each level consists of a container holding the aliens, sectioned off by a series of movable pins. The player must analyze the puzzle and pull the pins out in the correct order to release the aliens and let gravity do the rest.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game introduces several key mechanics:
*   **Color Spreading**: Some aliens start off colorless (white or grey). They must come into contact with the colored aliens to gain color before they can be collected.
*   **Obstacles**: Levels often contain hazards like bombs or explosives. The aliens must be kept away from these dangers.
*   **Physics**: The game is based on simple physics. You must understand how the balls will fall, mix, and flow once a pin is removed.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The challenge lies in figuring out the precise sequence of pin-pulls to ensure all colorless aliens are colored, all hazards are avoided, and all aliens successfully reach the UFO.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Plan Before You Pull**: This is the most important rule. Do not pull pins randomly. Take a moment to look at the entire setup and mentally trace the path the aliens will take for each possible pin-pull.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Color the Grey Aliens First**: Your top priority in most levels is to ensure the colorless aliens mix with the colored ones. Often, you will need to pull a pin that allows the colored aliens to drop down onto the colorless ones *before* you release them all towards the exit.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Isolate and Neutralize Bombs**: If there are bombs, the puzzle is usually about finding a way to either drop the bombs into a separate, harmless area, or to release the aliens in a way that they flow around the bombs. Never drop the aliens directly onto bombs.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **The Order Matters**: The sequence in which you pull the pins is everything. Pulling pin A before pin B might lead to success, while pulling B before A leads to failure. Think of it like a combination lock.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Look for Separators**: Some pins are there just to keep things separate (e.g., bombs from aliens, colored aliens from colorless ones). Understand the function of each pin before you remove it.

### **Controls Guide**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The controls are extremely simple and designed for one-touch mobile gameplay.

*   **Pull a Pin**: **Click and drag** the pin you want to remove out of its slot. Alternatively, a simple **tap** on the end of the pin often works as well.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Why did I lose the level? All the aliens got to the UFO!**

### **Frequently Asked questions (よくある質問)**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] You likely failed to color all the colorless (grey/white) aliens. Only colored aliens count as being successfully "saved." Make sure every alien has been colored before they enter the spaceship.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. I pulled a pin, and everything exploded. What did I do wrong?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] You allowed the aliens to come into contact with a bomb. The solution to these levels involves finding a way to get rid of the bombs first, or guiding the aliens along a path that safely avoids them.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. The level seems impossible. What should I do?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Every level has a specific solution. If you are stuck, try to rethink the order of your pin-pulls. The solution is often counter-intuitive. Consider pulling a pin that doesn't seem to lead directly to the exit, but instead sets up a better flow for the aliens.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. What is the goal of the game?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The goal is to successfully solve each puzzle level by getting all the colored aliens into the UFO, progressing through as many levels as possible.
