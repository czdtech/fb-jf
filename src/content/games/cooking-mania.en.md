### Detailed Game Introduction

Cooking Mania boils restaurant rush into quick levels: prep ingredients, assemble dishes in order, and serve before timers expire. Equipment upgrades, extra pans, and faster prep let you chain orders for bonus coins.

4.  Prioritize timers: Serve expiring orders before large combos.
5.  Queue logic: Arrange workspace to minimize cursor travel.

- Shop for upgrades between levels.
