### Detailed Game Introduction

HexaMind plays on a hexagonal grid with rules about what may touch: colors, numbers, or symbols must satisfy adjacency constraints (e.g., no equal neighbors, or sums along rays). The six‑direction geometry enables rich deductions through fan‑shaped lines and rings.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Constraint hotspots: Start at cells with the most neighbors or strictest rules.
2.  **[FR]** Ring logic: Use ring sums or color counts around a center to bound candidates.
3.  **[FR]** Ray scans: Scan along axial directions for parity/sequence constraints.
4.  **[FR]** Contradiction seeds: Try a candidate on a tight cell and backtrack on conflict.
5.  **[FR]** Pencil rigor: Maintain clean candidate notes to avoid circular mistakes.

### Controls Guide

- Tap to place values/colors; toggle pencil marks; undo/redo.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I’m stuck — where to look?

A: Revisit high‑degree nodes and ring totals; combine ring and ray constraints.

- Q: Is guessing required?

A: Good sets allow logical solves; when needed, make shallow, reversible assumptions.

- Q: How is it different from square‑grid puzzles?

A: Six neighbors create stronger ring/ray reasoning that square grids lack.
