    - **A:** If you don't reach the level's objective (like a target score) before the timer runs out, you will have to restart the level.

- **Form a Word:** Click on the first letter of the word you've found, hold the mouse button, and drag your cursor through all the adjacent letters of the word in order. Release the mouse button on the last letter to submit the word.

The game is played with a simple click-and-drag motion.

### Commandes

- **Use Hints When Stuck:** If the clock is ticking and you can't find any more words, use a hint. It can help you spot a word you overlooked and keep your momentum going.

- **Don't Forget Diagonals:** It's easy to spot horizontal and vertical words, but many players forget to look for diagonal connections. Make sure to scan the grid in all eight directions from each letter.

- **Longer Words, More Points:** While finding short three-letter words is easy, longer words are worth significantly more points. Always be on the lookout for words that are five, six, or even seven letters long.

- **Scan for Common Prefixes and Suffixes:** Look for common letter combinations like "S", "ED", "ER", or "ING". These can often be the start or end of multiple words, helping you find several words quickly.
