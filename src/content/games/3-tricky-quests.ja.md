[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Brain Test 3: Tricky Quests* is the third installment in the series from Unico Studio. While preserving the core "think outside the box" and "break the rules" puzzle-solving gameplay, this title introduces a significant evolution by incorporating stronger adventure and narrative elements, making it feel more like a puzzle-adventure game.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] In the game, players take on the role of **Alyx**, who embarks on a journey to find six Power Gems to save her magically trapped father. Unlike the level-based structure of its predecessors, *Brain Test 3* features an interconnected game world and a complete, overarching storyline.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Key Features:**

*   **Fusion of Adventure and Puzzles:** The game is no longer a linear sequence of levels. Players must explore different scenes, find items, and use them to solve puzzles that block their path.
*   **Inventory System:** This is the biggest new feature. Players can collect various items found in the environment and store them in Alyx's backpack. You need to figure out how to combine these items or apply them to specific scenarios at the right moment.
*   **Workshop System:** Alyx has a workshop where you can combine key quest items or upgrade your tools, preparing you for the adventures ahead.
*   **Interactive Dialogue:** The game introduces a dialogue choice system. By talking to NPCs (Non-Player Characters), you can obtain clues and advance the plot. Different choices can lead to different (and often humorous) outcomes.
*   **Classic Tricky Puzzles:** Despite the new systems, the heart of the game remains the same: tricky puzzles that require you to use your imagination and challenge conventional thinking. Classic interactions like dragging, shaking, and zooming are still key to finding solutions.

### **2. Game Walkthrough**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The strategy for *Brain Test 3* not only inherits the mindset of the previous games but also requires a greater focus on resource management and exploration.

*   **Core Principle: Explore and Collect**
    *   新しいエリアに入るときは、すぐにパズルを解こうとしないでください。まず、すべての怪しいオブジェクトを注意深く観察してタップし、インベントリに収集できるものを確認してください。
*   **Master Your Inventory:**
    *   **[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Drag and Use:** When facing a challenge, open your backpack and try dragging items from it onto characters or objects in the scene.
    *   **[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Combine Items:** Sometimes, you need to drag two items onto each other within the inventory to craft a new, more useful tool.
    *   **[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Check All Items:** Don't forget what you're carrying. The key to the current puzzle might be an inconspicuous item you collected a long time ago.
*   **Pay Attention to Clues in Dialogue:**
    *   [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Read all conversations carefully. NPCs' words often directly or indirectly hint at what you need to do next or what item you should be looking for.
*   **Checklist for When You're Stuck:**
    1.  [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Have I interacted with every element in the scene? (Tapping, dragging, rubbing, etc.)
    2.  [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Is there an item in my backpack that I can use here?
    3.  [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Can I combine items in my backpack to create a new tool?
    4.  [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Do I need to return to a previous scene to find a missed item?
    5.  [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Did I miss any key information in the dialogue?
*   **The Hint System is Still Your Friend:**
    *   [JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] If all else fails, the built-in "light bulb" hint system is still available. It will point you toward the critical step or the required item, helping you overcome the obstacle.
