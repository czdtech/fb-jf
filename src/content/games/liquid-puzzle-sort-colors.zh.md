### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Liquid puzzle sort colors adapts the viral bottle‑sorting formula: pour liquids between bottles so each ends up uniform. You can pour only onto the same color or an empty bottle. Success demands planning buffers and ordering pours to avoid softlocks where no move remains.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Keep two buffers empty if possible; they’re your escape valves.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Build from completed bottles outward; lock finished colors early.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Top‑down pours: Move top colors to consolidate stacks before addressing deep layers.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Avoid burying singletons; surface odd colors early to prevent traps.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Deadlock check: If all moves reverse progress, undo and change the pour order.

### Controls Guide

- Tap a source bottle, then a destination; undo/reset if available; hints may suggest a pour.
