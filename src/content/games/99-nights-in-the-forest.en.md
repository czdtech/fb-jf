### **99 Nights in the Forest Game Introduction**

*99 Nights in the Forest* is a first-person survival horror game focused on resource management and base defense. The player is trapped in a cursed forest with a single objective: survive for 99 consecutive nights by defending a dilapidated cabin from monstrous creatures that attack each night.

The game's core mechanic is its distinct **day-night cycle**:
*   **Daytime**: A brief and relatively safe period. Players must use this time efficiently to venture into the forest to gather essential resources. This primarily includes: **Wood** (for crafting planks), **Scrap Metal** (for crafting nails), and **Food/Water** (to maintain vitals).
*   **Nighttime**: When night falls, unknown creatures from the forest awaken and will actively attack the cabin. Players must stay inside, use the resources gathered during the day to craft and fortify defenses (like barricading windows with planks and nails), and be prepared to fight if their defenses are breached.

The game heavily emphasizes **preparation and planning**. Your efficiency during the day directly determines your chances of survival at night. As the days progress, the number and aggression of the enemies will increase, presenting a tougher challenge to your resource stockpile and defensive strategy. A key feature of the game is **permadeath**—if the player dies, they must start over from Day 1.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

1.  **Day One Goal: Barricade All Windows**: Your sole objective on your first day should be to gather enough wood and scrap metal to craft planks and nails and board up every single window in the cabin before nightfall. This is the most basic requirement for surviving the early nights.
2.  **Resource Priority: Wood > Scrap Metal > Food**:
    *   **Wood** is the foundation of your defense and is needed in large quantities. You should spend a significant portion of each day chopping trees.
    *   **Scrap Metal** is used to craft nails, without which you cannot install planks. It is often harder to find than wood and requires careful searching.
    *   **Food and Water**, while essential, are consumed relatively slowly in the beginning. Focus on securing your defenses before you go on extensive searches for sustenance.
3.  **Fortifications Require Maintenance**: Enemies will damage the planks on your windows. During the day, you need to inspect and repair damaged barricades. In later stages, you may need to apply two or even three layers of planks to withstand more ferocious attacks.
4.  **Sound is a Critical Alarm**: While inside the cabin at night, listen carefully. You can use the sounds of footsteps, impacts, and growls to pinpoint the location and number of enemies, allowing you to anticipate which barricade is being targeted and prepare for repairs or a fight.
5.  **Combat is a Last Resort**: While you can fight back with tools like an axe, it is extremely risky. Your primary goal is to **keep the enemies out**, not to kill them. You are only forced to fight when a barricade is completely destroyed and an enemy enters the cabin.
6.  **Upgrade Progressively**: Don't get complacent. As the game progresses, you must continuously reinforce your defenses. For example, use more planks and nails to upgrade your window barricades, making them more durable.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**1. Can the enemies in the game be killed?**
Yes. If an enemy breaches your defenses and enters the cabin, you can attack it with an axe or other weapons until it is dead. However, this usually means your defense has failed and you are in a very dangerous situation. Therefore, the core strategy should always be defense, not offense.

**2. What happens if I die?**
The game features a **permadeath** mechanic. This means that if you die, your save file is deleted, and you must start the entire game over from Night 1, losing all prior progress.

**3. How do I survive the first night?**
On the first day, chop down at least 2-3 trees to get enough logs and search the surrounding ground for scrap metal. Open your inventory to craft the logs into planks and the scrap metal into nails. Before sunset, use the planks and nails to barricade all the windows (usually by pressing `E` to interact). After dark, stay inside, close the door, and listen carefully to the sounds outside.

**4. Where can I find Scrap Metal?**
Scrap metal is usually found scattered on the forest floor or near certain landmarks. Its spawn locations are random, requiring players to explore carefully during the day. It is the only material for crafting nails and is therefore critically important.
