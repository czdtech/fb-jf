### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Mahjong Classic is the timeless single-player puzzle game that uses a set of Mahjong tiles. The goal is not to form winning hands as in traditional Mahjong, but to systematically clear a stacked layout of tiles by finding and matching identical pairs. It’s a game that tests your observation skills and strategic thinking, providing a relaxing yet engaging mental workout.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **The Rule of Free Tiles:** You can only select and match tiles that are "free." A tile is considered free if it can be moved left or right without being blocked by another tile, and it has no other tiles sitting on top of it.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Strategic Matching:** Don't just match the first pair you see. Think about which matches will open up the most new tiles. Prioritizing pairs that unblock heavily stacked areas of the board is key to success.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Handle Multiples with Care:** If you see three or four identical free tiles, pause and consider which pair to match. The wrong choice could leave the other pair blocked permanently. Choose the pair that will be most beneficial for future moves.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Flower and Season Tiles:** Remember that any Flower tile can be matched with any other Flower tile, and the same goes for Season tiles. They don't need to be identical. Use these flexible matches to your advantage, especially when you're stuck.

### Controls Guide

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is played with simple mouse clicks or taps.

*   **Select & Match:** Click on a free tile to highlight it. Then, click on another identical, free tile to remove both from the board.
*   **Hints/Shuffle:** Most versions include a "Hint" button to show you a possible match and a "Shuffle" button to rearrange the tiles if no moves are available.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: Why can't I click on a tile?**
     *   **A:** The tile is not "free." It is either blocked on both its left and right sides by other tiles, or another tile is lying on top of it.

*   **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
     *   **A:** The goal is to clear 100% of the tiles from the board by matching them in pairs.

*   **Q: I have no more moves. Is the game over?**
     *   **A:** Not necessarily. If no more pairs can be matched, the game will usually offer you a "Shuffle" option to rearrange the remaining tiles and create new possibilities.
