### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Festive Power-ups:** The key to clearing the board is creating special items by matching more than three ornaments.
    *   **Match 4:** Creates a line-clearing ornament that zaps an entire row or column.
    *   **Match 5 (L or T shape):** Creates a Bomb ornament that explodes in a festive burst, clearing surrounding items.
    *   **Match 5 (in a line):** Creates a special multi-color ornament that can clear all items of a single color from the board.

2.  **Combine for Holiday Magic:** For the biggest effects, swap two special power-ups with each other. This will trigger a powerful board-clearing combination, perfect for solving the toughest puzzles.
3.  **Focus on the Level Goal:** Each level has a unique objective, like clearing all the snowy blocks or dropping presents to the bottom of the board. Concentrate your moves on achieving these goals before you run out of turns.
4.  **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches near the bottom of the board can create cascades, where new items fall and create automatic matches, helping you clear the level more efficiently.
