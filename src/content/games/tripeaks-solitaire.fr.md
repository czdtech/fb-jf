### Foire aux questions (FAQ)

- **Draw a Card:** Click on the face-down stock pile when you have no other moves.

- **Play a Card:** Click on a valid face-up card on the tableau to move it to the waste pile.

The game is played entirely with the mouse or by tapping.

### Commandes

- **Creating Long Runs:** The key to a high score is to create the longest possible sequence of moves without drawing from the stock pile. Each card cleared in a single run increases the combo bonus.

- **Drawing from Stock:** If you can no longer make any matches from the tableau, click on the stock pile to deal a new card onto the waste pile, giving you a new base card to play on.

- **Uncovering Cards:** When you remove a card from the tableau, any face-down cards beneath it are turned over, making them available for play.

- **Aces and Kings:** The ranks are wrapping. This means you can place a King on an Ace, and an Ace on a King, which is crucial for extending your runs.

- **Making a Move:** Look at the face-up card on the waste pile. You can click on any face-up card from the tableau that is one rank directly above or below it. For example, if the waste card is a 7, you can play either a 6 or an 8 from the tableau onto it. Suit does not matter.

- **The Goal:** Clear all cards from the three peaks on the tableau.

### Guide de jeu

Tripeaks Solitaire is a popular and fast-paced solitaire variant that combines elements of Golf Solitaire and Pyramid Solitaire. The game gets its name from the initial layout of the cards, which are dealt into three overlapping pyramids, or "peaks." The objective is to clear the entire tableau by selecting cards that are one rank higher or lower than the card on the waste pile, creating long runs and clearing the board before you run out of cards in your stock.
