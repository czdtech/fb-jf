### Detailed Game Introduction

Go Escape is a minimalist room‑escape platformer: spikes, moving saws, and timed gates demand crisp inputs and patient reads. Levels are short but punishing; the fun lies in mastering each room’s rhythm, then executing a clean run.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Read cycles: Watch a full trap cycle before committing; move on predictable beats.
2.  **[KO]** Short hops: Prefer small taps for precision over full presses that overshoot.
3.  **[KO]** Buffer inputs: If supported, press slightly early to catch platform windows.
4.  **[KO]** Route safety: Take slower, safer lanes first for consistent clears.
5.  **[KO]** Checkpoint mindset: Mentally segment rooms; reset focus after each success.

### Controls Guide

- Move/Jump: Arrows/WASD + Space; some levels add wall‑jump/double‑jump.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I keep clipping traps — how to stop?

A: You’re moving on guesses. Watch cycles, count beats, and move only on consistent windows.

- Q: Any tip for narrow gaps?

A: Use lightweight taps and approach from flatter angles.

- Q: Is there a timer?

A: Many rooms are untimed; consistency beats speedruns until you learn layouts.
