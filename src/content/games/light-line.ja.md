### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Light Line tasks you with drawing non‑overlapping paths that connect glowing nodes while obeying constraints: maximum turns, limited line length, mandatory pass‑throughs, or switches that toggle gates. Later puzzles add layered boards with energy sharing between lines.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Start with bottlenecks: Fill narrow corridors first; they force unique routes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Degree logic: Prioritize nodes with few exits; resolve them to reduce branching.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Turn economy: Use long straight runs and save turns for corners that require them.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Gate timing: Plan switch routes so gates open before line arrival.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Backtrack early: Undo as soon as crossings become inevitable.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to draw/erase lines; tap switches; zoom/pan on dense boards.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Lines always collide — how to avoid?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Lay corridors first and route remaining lines around them; avoid spirals that trap space.

- Q: Are diagonal moves allowed?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Usually grid‑orthogonal; check the level rules.

- Q: Is there a hint system?
