### Detailed Game Introduction

Tic Tac Toe Mania modernizes noughts‑and‑crosses with clean visuals and variants (bigger boards, misère). Core play is about forcing lines or neutralizing threats; perfect 3×3 play draws unless a mistake occurs.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Center first: On 3×3, center maximizes forks; corners second.
2.  Block immediately: Always respond to a two‑in‑a‑row.
3.  Create forks: Set up positions where two lines can win next.
4.  Anti‑fork: Play to break opponent fork patterns.
5.  Variants: On larger boards, prioritize flexible lines over early corners.

### Controls Guide

- Click squares to place marks; local 2P common; AI difficulties vary.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: Is 3×3 always a draw?
  
  A: With perfect play, yes; wins rely on opponent errors.

- Q: Best first move?
  
  A: Center, then corner.
