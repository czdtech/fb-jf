### Game Introduction

Snake.io is a popular online multiplayer game that puts a modern spin on the classic snake concept. Players control a snake-like avatar and compete against other players in real-time to become the largest and longest snake on the server. The primary objective is to grow your snake by consuming glowing pellets scattered throughout the game area while strategically defeating opponents by forcing them to collide with your body.

### Gameplay Guide

Your main goal is to grow by eating pellets. The pellets left behind by a defeated snake will make you grow much faster than the standard scattered ones. To defeat an opponent, you must trick them into running their head into your snake's body. When a snake is defeated, it transforms into a large trail of valuable pellets. Be careful, as your game ends if you run into another snake's body or the arena walls.

### Controls Guide

**PC/Web Browser:**
- **Mouse:** Your snake follows the direction of your mouse cursor.
- **Keyboard:** Use the `WASD` or arrow keys for movement.
- **Speed Boost:** Hold the left mouse button or the spacebar to get a burst of speed. Using the boost consumes your mass, so use it wisely.

**Mobile:**
- Use the on-screen virtual joystick or touch and drag your finger to guide the snake.
