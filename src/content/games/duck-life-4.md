### Overview
Train a racing duck across mini‑games (running, swimming, flying, climbing), then enter regional tournaments. Energy controls stamina; hats and evolutions change looks.

### How to Play
- Improve each stat via its training mini‑game; avoid obstacles to gain XP quickly.
- Feed seeds to raise energy; low energy reduces race endurance.
- Win qualifying heats to unlock new areas and tournaments.

### Controls
- Arrows/Mouse depending on mini‑game; Space to jump in runners (host dependent).

### Tips
- Rotate training so no single stat bottlenecks a race.
- Keep energy topped off before tournaments.
- Re‑run earlier tracks to grind safe XP if stuck.

### FAQ
- Q: Do cosmetics affect speed?  
  A: Hats are cosmetic; progression comes from stats and energy.
- Q: Can I respec?  
  A: No—just keep training the needed stat.
- Q: Why am I losing photo‑finish races?  
  A: Usually low energy or one stat (e.g., climbing) is behind.
