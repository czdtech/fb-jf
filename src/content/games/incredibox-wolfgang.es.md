### **Incredibox "Wolfgang" Game Introduction**

*Incredibox Wolfgang* is an elegant and masterfully crafted fan-made mod for the music creation game Incredibox. This version is a tribute to the era of **classical music**, heavily inspired by the works of the legendary composer, **Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart**.

The game transforms the usual beatboxers into a troupe of 18th-century performers, complete with powdered wigs and formal attire. Players use the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop interface to compose with a palette of 20 sound icons. The sound library is a complete orchestral and choral experience, featuring sounds from **harpsichords, violins, cellos, orchestral percussion, and powerful operatic vocals**.

The objective is to allow players to create their own sophisticated classical pieces while also engaging in the puzzle of finding the three secret animated bonuses. These bonuses are beautifully animated vignettes that perfectly capture the grace and drama of the classical era.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

Strategy in *Incredibox Wolfgang* is about understanding classical arrangement and layering orchestral parts to create a rich, harmonious composition.

1.  **[ES]** **Understand the Orchestral Sound Categories**:
    *   **[ES]** **Beats**: The rhythm section here is the foundation of the orchestra. Expect to find the deep, rhythmic plucking of a **cello (pizzicato)**, the powerful boom of **timpani drums**, and other foundational percussive elements.
    *   **[ES]** **Effects**: This category provides the harmonic and textural background. It includes sounds like flowing **harpsichord arpeggios**, sustained notes from string sections, and other ambient orchestral colors.
    *   **[ES]** **Melodies**: These are the main melodic lines that carry the tune. This category features the soaring sounds of **violins**, elegant flute passages, and other lead instrumental hooks.
    *   **[ES]** **Voices**: The vocals are purely operatic. This includes powerful **choral arrangements**, solo soprano and tenor voices, and dramatic harmonies that give the piece its human, emotional core.

2.  **[ES]** **Build Your Orchestra from the Ground Up**: A good way to compose is to mimic how an orchestra is built. Start with the "Beats" category to lay down a rhythmic and harmonic foundation with the cellos and timpani.

3.  **[ES]** **Master Counterpoint and Harmony**: Classical music is all about how different melodies and harmonies interact. Experiment with layering different "Melody" and "Voice" icons on top of each other. Some will create beautiful harmonies, while others might clash. The discovery is part of the fun.

4.  **[ES]** **Systematic Search for Bonuses**: The bonus combinations can be tricky to find. Lock in a core arrangement that sounds good, then methodically cycle through the remaining icons one by one. This is the most efficient way to unlock the elegant animations.

5.  **[ES]** **Use Solo to Appreciate Each Part**: The instrumentation in this mod is very detailed. Use the "solo" function to isolate the violin or a solo singer to fully appreciate their individual performance and understand their role in the full ensemble.

### **Controls Guide**

The controls follow the standard, intuitive drag-and-drop interface of the official Incredibox games.

*   **[ES]** **Add a Sound**: **Drag** a sound icon from the bottom and **drop** it onto one of the performers.
*   **[ES]** **Remove a Sound**: Click the "X" on an active sound icon at the bottom, or drag a new sound onto an existing character to replace it.
*   **[ES]** **Mute / Unmute**: **Click** on a performing character to mute them; click again to unmute.
*   **[ES]** **Solo**: Click the **small button** next to an active character to mute all other performers.
*   **[ES]** **Record**: Click the **record button** to start and stop recording your classical masterpiece.
