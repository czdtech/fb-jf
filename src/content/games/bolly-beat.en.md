### Detailed Game Introduction

Bolly Beat is a light, accessible rhythm‑tapping game themed around energetic, upbeat Bollywood‑style tracks. Notes approach cues on screen and you must tap with accurate timing to keep the combo alive. Higher accuracy yields higher scores and star ratings, while streaks unlock bonus multipliers and more challenging patterns.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Learn the timing windows: Focus on hitting on the beat; late/early hits break combos and reduce multipliers.
2.  Read patterns early: Keep your eyes slightly ahead of the hit line to anticipate alternating hands or double‑taps.
3.  Use audio cues: Let the drum/bass line guide your rhythm when visual density is high.
4.  Warm up on Normal: Build consistency before tackling Hard charts to avoid plateauing with bad habits.
5.  Recover smartly: If you drop a combo, stabilize your timing before chasing max stars again.

### Controls Guide

- Tap/Click cues: Tap when notes reach the hit area; some charts may include holds or swipes.
- Pause/Retry: Use on‑screen controls to pause or restart a track.
- Volume: Adjust music/sfx for clearer beat tracking.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Do I need headphones? Recommended—clearer timing helps accuracy and combo stability.
- Why do I miss on dense sections? Try lowering note speed or focusing on the downbeat; practice sections that introduce cross‑rhythms.
- How to increase score? Maintain long combos and prioritize “Perfect” accuracy to raise multipliers.
