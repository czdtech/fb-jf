### Game Introduction

"Word Search" is a classic puzzle game where players find hidden words in a grid of letters, searching horizontally, vertically, and diagonally to complete themed word lists. This is a relaxing brain exercise game that helps improve vocabulary and observation skills.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Systematic Scanning**: Scan the grid systematically by rows or columns, don't jump around randomly.
2.  **Multi-directional Thinking**: Remember words can appear in 8 different directions (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
3.  **Find Long Words First**: Long words are usually easier to spot; finding them first can narrow the search area.
4.  **Marking Strategy**: Mark words immediately after finding them to avoid repeated searches.
5.  **Theme Association**: Use theme hints to predict what types of words might appear.

### How to Play

*   **Select Words**: Use mouse drag or click to select found words.
*   **Multi-directional Selection**: Can select words from any direction (forward/backward, up/down, diagonal).
*   **View List**: Check the word list to see which words still need to be found.
*   **Hint Feature**: Some versions provide hint features to help find difficult words.
