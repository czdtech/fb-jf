### Detailed Game Introduction

Tractor Mania is a physics hauler: throttle control and balance keep trailers steady over bumps. Spilled cargo costs rewards; smooth driving beats speed.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Gentle throttle on inclines; avoid wheel‑spin.
2.  Lean to counter pitch; keep trailer level.
3.  Brake before descents; coast down.
4.  Secure partial loads first on tough routes.
5.  Upgrade tires/suspension before engines if available.

### Controls Guide

- Throttle/Brake: W/S or Up/Down; Lean: A/D or Left/Right.
