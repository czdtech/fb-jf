### Detailed Game Introduction

Football Kickoff focuses on American‑football kicking scenarios: placekick field goals, directional kickoffs, and occasional punts. Wind, snap timing, and laces matter; clean timing on the power meter and correct aim decide distance and accuracy.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Wind read: Offset aim into the wind; stronger winds require larger compensation.
2.  Power timing: Stop near the sweet spot; over‑powering increases hook/slice risk.
3.  Trajectory: For long kicks, add arc; for short accuracy, lower arc reduces drift.
4.  Kickoff placement: Target corners to limit returns; vary depth to force poor field position.
5.  Punts: Aim for coffin corner and hang time to allow coverage.
