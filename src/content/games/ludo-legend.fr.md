### Detailed Game Introduction

Ludo Legend is a fantastic digital version of the beloved classic board game, Ludo. The game is a race to the finish! Each player has four tokens and the goal is to get all of them from the starting yard, around the entire board, and into the home column. Play against computer opponents, roll the dice, and use strategy to capture your opponents' tokens and send them back to the start. Become a Ludo Legend by being the first to get all your tokens home!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **Getting Out of the Yard:** You must roll a six to move a token from your starting yard onto the game board. Prioritize getting at least one token into play as soon as possible.
2.  **[FR]** **Strategic Movement:** Once you have tokens on the board, you can choose which one to move based on your dice roll. It's often wise to have multiple tokens in play to give you more options.
3.  **[FR]** **Capturing Opponents:** If you land on a square occupied by a single opponent's token, you capture it and send it back to their yard. This is a key way to set back your competition.
4.  **[FR]** **Safety in Numbers:** Landing two of your own tokens on the same space creates a block. Opponents cannot pass a block, making it a powerful defensive strategy.
5.  **[FR]** **The Home Stretch:** To win, you must move all four of your tokens into your colored home column and then into the final home triangle. You need an exact dice roll to move a token into the home triangle.

### Controls Guide
