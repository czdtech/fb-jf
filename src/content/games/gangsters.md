### Overview
Wobbly rooftop shootouts for one or two players. Bullets and recoil affect your stance; the goal is to topple your opponent.

### How to Play
- Time jumps to dodge bullets and adjust aim height.
- Use recoil to your advantage to tilt or slide the enemy’s stance.
- Environmental props can block shots or cause ricochets.

### Controls
- One‑button jump/shoot per player (host dependent) or separate keys for actions.

### Tips
- Short hops steady aim; big hops dodge and reposition.
- Aim at feet to pop opponents upward and off balance.
- Watch wind or moving platforms when present.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I win rounds consistently?  
  A: Control recoil and land shots that destabilize your opponent’s footing.
- Q: Is there a two‑player mode on one keyboard?  
  A: Yes, most hosts provide side‑by‑side key bindings.
- Q: Do headshots deal extra damage?  
  A: Usually knockback/positioning matters more than raw damage.
