### Game Introduction

"Puppet Master" is a quirky physics-based puzzle game where players control a puppet character through challenging obstacles and levels by manipulating its movement and limbs to reach the goal. The game is famous for its unique control scheme and humorous animation effects, providing players with an entertaining yet challenging gaming experience.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Master the Controls**: Familiarize yourself with controlling each body part of the puppet, learning to coordinate the movement of arms, legs, and other limbs.
2.  **Utilize Physics**: Make good use of the game's physics engine through swinging, pushing, pulling, and grasping actions to overcome obstacles.
3.  **Observe Environment**: Carefully observe environmental elements in levels such as platforms, ropes, and buttons to find the best path to completion.
4.  **Be Patient**: Due to the complex controls, it takes multiple attempts to master the techniques. Don't get discouraged by failures.
5.  **Think Creatively**: Sometimes unconventional solutions may be more effective than standard methods; try different approaches.
