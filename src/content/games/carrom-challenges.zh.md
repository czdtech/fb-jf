### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Carrom Challenges simulates the tabletop striker‑and‑carrommen game. Use the striker to pocket your pieces (and possibly the queen under cover) while controlling angles and rebound speed. Fouls, cover rules, and limited strokes add tactical depth.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Opening break: Spread pieces while keeping center control; avoid scratching.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pocket order: Secure easy covers for the queen; don’t leave it exposed.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Speed control: Gentle hits improve precision and reduce rebounds.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bank lines: Learn common angles off the boards for tough pockets.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Safety: When no high‑percentage shot exists, leave opponents snookered.

### Controls Guide

- Aim by dragging the cursor arc; set power with the slider; release to strike.
- Rules panel explains fouls/queen cover for the current mode.
