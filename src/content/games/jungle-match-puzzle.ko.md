### Detailed Game Introduction

Jungle Match Puzzle is a colorful match‑3 with vines, crates, and sticky tiles as blockers. You must complete scene goals (score, collect idols, free animals) within move limits. Combining power‑ups (bomb + line, double line) wipes dense foliage and opens the board for cascading clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Objective‑first: Prioritize blocker clears and collect goals before pure scoring.
2.  **[KO]** Bottom clears: Work from the bottom to spawn cascades that remove blockers above.
3.  **[KO]** Power‑up combos: Merge for board‑wide effects; save strong combos for clustered blockers.
4.  **[KO]** Move economy: Map 2–3 moves ahead; avoid isolating colors near walls.
5.  **[KO]** Hazard awareness: Sticky tiles require adjacent matches; plan detours.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to swap; activate power‑ups by matching/tapping; pause/retry via UI.
