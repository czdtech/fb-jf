### Présentation

Ce jeu de tennis arcade simple te met face à un adversaire contrôlé par l’IA.
But : marquer plus de points que lui en l’obligeant à rater ses retours.

### Guide rapide

- **Service :** envoie la balle dans le carré de service adverse pour lancer
  l’échange.
- **Échanges :** renvoie la balle avant qu’elle ne rebondisse deux fois.
- **Points :** tu marques si l’adversaire tape dans le filet, dehors ou laisse

- **Scoring:** You score a point if your opponent hits the ball out of bounds, into the net, or fails to return it before it bounces twice.
  rebondir deux fois.

### Commandes


Controls are designed to be simple and intuitive:
- déplacement : flèches ou WASD  
- frappe : barre d’espace ou `X` (timing = direction/puissance)



Many classic tennis games feature a 2-player mode where you can compete against a friend on the same keyboard.

**Can I play against another person?**

In most classic tennis games, your shot direction is determined by when you hit the ball relative to your player's body. Hitting it early sends it cross-court, while hitting it late sends it down the line.

**How can I aim my shots?**

In a standard game, points are scored as 15, 30, 40, and then game point. You need to win by at least two points. Many arcade versions simplify this to just winning a set number of points (e.g., first to 7).
