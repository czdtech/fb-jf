### Detailed Game Introduction

Powerwall is a minimalist, high-energy arcade game that tests your reflexes and timing. The objective is to defend your goal line by activating a temporary energy barrier—the Powerwall—to block a fast-moving ball. As the ball ricochets around the arena, its speed increases, demanding quicker reactions. The longer you can survive without letting the ball pass, the higher your score will be.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Timing is Everything:** The core mechanic is activating your Powerwall at the precise moment the ball is about to hit your goal line. Activate it too early, and the wall will disappear. Activate it too late, and the ball will get through. Practice your timing to get a feel for the rhythm.
2.  **[KO]** **Focus on the Ball:** Keep your eyes locked on the ball's trajectory. Don't get distracted by anything else on the screen. Anticipate its path after it bounces off other walls.
3.  **[KO]** **Stay Calm Under Pressure:** As the ball speeds up, it's easy to panic and click too early. Try to remain calm and focused, reacting only when necessary.
4.  **[KO]** **Learn the Angles:** Pay attention to the angles at which the ball bounces. This will help you predict where it will go next and prepare for your next block.

### Controls Guide

*   **[KO]** **Activate Powerwall:** Click the left mouse button or tap the screen to activate your energy barrier. The wall only stays active for a very short period, so timing is critical.
