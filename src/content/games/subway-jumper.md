### Detailed Game Introduction

Subway Jumper plays like a classic three‑lane runner: trains, cones, and barriers demand late jumps and decisive slides. Coins and power‑ups tempt risky lines; consistency earns longer streaks and better scores.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Eyes up two obstacles; don’t stare at your feet.
2.  Late jumps for low hurdles; slides for bars and tunnels.
3.  Skip side coins when alignment is off.
4.  Use shields/magnets in dense sections only.
5.  After a mistake, reset rhythm before speeding up.

### Controls Guide

- A/D or Left/Right to switch lanes; Space/Up to jump; Down to slide; power‑ups via keys.
