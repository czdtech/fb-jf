### Overview
Google Snake updates the classic formula with clean visuals and optional modes. Eat fruit to grow while avoiding walls and your own tail. Speed rises as you survive longer; variant rules change board size, obstacles, and item effects.

### How to Play
- Plan routes that leave escape lanes; never box yourself in.
- Use the outer ring for long straight runs; dive inward for pickups.
- Adapt to special items/modes as enabled by the host.

### Controls
- Arrow keys or WASD to steer; pause/restart via UI.

### Tips
- Don’t turn 180° into your neck—make wide turns.
- Keep the tail straight when possible to maximize options.
- When fast, pre‑input turns one tile early.

### FAQ
- Q: How can I avoid running into my own tail?  
  A: Keep the tail compact by using straight segments and avoid tight spirals.
- Q: Does the game get faster over time?  
  A: Yes, most versions increase speed with score.
- Q: Are there different board setups?  
  A: Many hosts offer sizes, obstacles, and item variants.
