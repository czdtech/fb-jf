### Detailed Game Introduction

Collect Same Thing challenges you to match identical tiles or items under space/time limits. Removing pairs reveals deeper layers; success requires opening lanes, prioritizing scarce tiles, and avoiding isolated singles.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Open lanes first to expose hidden tiles.
2.  **[DE]** Match scarce items early before they clog the board.
3.  **[DE]** Work bottom‑up to create cascades (when layers exist).
4.  **[DE]** Avoid cornering singletons that have few partners.
5.  **[DE]** Save shuffles/hints for emergencies.

### Controls Guide

- Click/tap to select pairs per mode rules.
- Use hint/shuffle (if available) sparingly.
