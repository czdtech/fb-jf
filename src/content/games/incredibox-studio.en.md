### Incredibox Studio Introduction

Incredibox Studio is a fan-made project. Unlike the official Incredibox versions, which are based on pre-defined sets of sounds, this "Studio" version offers a sandbox-like experience. Players are given a wide array of sounds and effects to drag, drop, and mix, empowering them to create their own unique beats and musical compositions from scratch. It's a creative playground for fans of the original game who want to explore their own musical ideas.

### Gameplay Strategy / Creative Tips

*   Since this is a sandbox, the "strategy" is about creativity.
    1.  **Build a Foundation**: Start with a solid beat and a bass line. This provides the backbone for your track.
    2.  **Layer Sounds**: Gradually add melodies, harmonies, and vocal effects. Don't add too many sounds at once, as it can become chaotic.
    3.  **Experiment**: The key is to experiment. Drag and drop different sounds to see what works well together. Some combinations might unlock special animations or chorus effects.
    4.  **Use Mute/Solo**: Isolate specific tracks using the mute or solo buttons to fine-tune each part of your composition.

### Controls Guide

*   The game is controlled entirely with the `mouse`.
    *   **Add Sound**: `Drag` an icon from the bottom panel and `drop` it onto one of the characters.
    *   **Remove Sound**: `Drag` a character's icon off of them.
    *   **Mute/Solo**: `Click` the headphones or speaker icon next to a character to solo or mute their sound.
    *   **Record**: `Click` the record button (usually a red circle) at the top to start and stop recording your mix.
