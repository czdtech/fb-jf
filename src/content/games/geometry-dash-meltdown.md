### Overview
Standalone set of Geometry Dash levels with distinct visual themes and songs; expect spikes, pads, portals, and ship/ball sections.

### How to Play
- Learn patterns in practice, then execute full runs.
- Tap on the beat; hold ship/ball sections with gentle inputs.
- Use jump pads and rings precisely; over‑tapping causes misses.

### Controls
- Tap/Space/Mouse to jump; hold to fly (host dependent).

### Tips
- Turn off heavy effects if timing feels late.
- Count beats aloud for early learning.

### FAQ

  A: Yes, Meltdown features its own curated tracks and layouts.
- Q: Can I use practice mode here?  
  A: Most hosts include a practice option with checkpoints.
- Q: Is there user‑generated content?  
  A: Meltdown focuses on built‑in levels; UGC depends on host.
