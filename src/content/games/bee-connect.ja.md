### **Game Introduction**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Bee Connect* is a challenging and strategic number-merging puzzle game set on a hexagonal beehive grid. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible by strategically combining numbered tiles to create tiles with higher values.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Unlike classic 2048-style games, the core mechanic of *Bee Connect* requires players to connect a group of **four or more adjacent, identical numbers** to merge them into a single tile of a higher value. For example, grouping four '2' tiles together will merge them into one '8' tile.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Players move tiles one by one into adjacent empty cells. However, there's a catch: **if a move does not result in a merge, new numbers from the queue at the top of the screen will be added to the board**, filling up valuable space. Tiles that are completely surrounded by other tiles cannot be moved. The game ends when the board is full and no more moves can be made.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Always Plan for a Merge**: This is the golden rule. Every move you make should ideally result in a merge. Moving a tile just to reposition it is costly, as it will add more random numbers to the board and reduce your available space.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Group, Don't Scatter**: Actively try to keep identical numbers close to each other. Your goal is to create clusters of three, setting them up for a fourth tile to complete the merge. Avoid leaving a single '8' tile isolated on the far side of the board from your other '8's.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Think Several Moves Ahead**: Look at the queue of upcoming numbers at the top. This information is crucial. If you see two '1's are coming, you can prepare a space for them next to your existing '1's to set up an easy merge.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Utilize the Hexagonal Grid**: The hexagonal grid offers more adjacent spaces (up to six) than a square grid. Use this to your advantage to create more complex and flexible groupings. You can often connect four tiles in non-linear shapes.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Keep the Center Clear**: Try to push merges towards the edges of the board. Keeping the central area open provides more flexibility for moving and arranging tiles, preventing your key pieces from getting trapped early.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 6.  **Save Your Power-ups**: The lightning bolt icon is a powerful tool, likely for clearing a single tile or another helpful action. Don't use it on a whim. Save it for critical moments when you need to clear a specific tile to prevent the board from locking up or to enable a game-saving merge.

### **Controls Guide**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is designed for simple drag-and-drop or click-based gameplay.

*   **Move a Tile**: **Click and drag** a numbered tile to an adjacent empty honeycomb cell. Alternatively, some versions may use a **click-to-select, click-to-place** system.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Why did new numbers suddenly appear on the board?**


### **Frequently Asked Questions (よくある質問)**
- **Move a Tile**: **Click and drag** a numbered tile to an adjacent empty honeycomb cell. Alternatively, some versions may use a **click-to-select, click-to-place** system.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (よくある質問)**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] This is the game's core penalty mechanic. It happens whenever you move a tile, and that move does not immediately create a group of four or more matching tiles.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. Why can't I move a specific tile?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The tile is "trapped." A tile can only be moved if there is at least one empty, adjacent honeycomb cell to move it into. If it is completely surrounded by other tiles, it is stuck.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. How many tiles do I need to make a match?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] You need to create an adjacent group of **at least four** identical tiles. Three tiles next to each other will not merge.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. What is the goal of the game?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The primary goal is to survive for as long as possible and achieve the highest score. A secondary goal for experts is to create the highest possible number tile (e.g., 1024, 2048, etc.) by repeatedly merging.
