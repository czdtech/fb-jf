### Game Introduction

"Murder" is a tense and exciting social deduction game. Among a group of players, one is secretly designated as the "murderer," whose goal is to secretly eliminate other players without being discovered. Other players, on the other hand, need to observe, deduce, and discuss to identify the murderer and stop them. The game is full of strategy and psychological warfare, with each game session full of uncertainty.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **For the Murderer**: 
    *   **Act in Secret**: Choose the right time and place to secretly eliminate targets.
    *   **Create Alibis**: Interact with others or move around to create confusion.
    *   **Avoid Exposure**: Stay calm and do not exhibit unusual behavior.
2.  **For the Civilians**: 
    *   **Observe Behavior**: Pay attention to unusual actions from other players, such as acting alone or frequently approaching targets.
    *   **Gather Clues**: Look for in-game hints or events that might point to the murderer.
    *   **Reason Logically**: Through discussion and analysis, gradually narrow down the list of suspects.
3.  **General Strategies**: 
    *   **Maintain Communication**: Civilians need to communicate effectively and share information.
    *   **Utilize Environment**: Familiarity with the game map and mechanics can help the murderer hide better or civilians find clues faster.

### How to Play

*   **Movement**: Typically use keyboard arrow keys or WASD keys to control character movement.
*   **Interaction**: When near objects or other players, there might be interaction prompts (e.g., pick up weapons, talk).
*   **Murderer Abilities**: The murderer will have specific abilities to eliminate targets; the exact operation depends on the game version (e.g., clicking on a target or using a skill key).
*   **Civilian Self-defense**: In some game versions, civilians can defend themselves or fight back under certain conditions.
