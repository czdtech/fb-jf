### Detailed Game Introduction

Traffic Tom is a fast-paced, third-person motorbike racing game that puts you in the middle of a bustling highway. As the adventurous cat, Tom, your goal is to skillfully weave through dense traffic, dodge cars and buses, and complete challenging missions to earn coins. Use your earnings to upgrade your current bike or save up to buy new, more powerful motorcycles on your quest to become the king of the road.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Look Ahead:** The key to survival is anticipation. Don't just look at the car directly in front of you; scan far down the road to see traffic patterns forming. This will give you plenty of time to switch lanes safely.
2.  **Focus on Missions:** While surviving is important, completing the missions for each level is how you progress. Pay attention to whether your goal is to overtake a certain number of cars, travel a specific distance, or collect items.
3.  **Close Calls for More Points:** Many driving games reward you for near misses. Safely overtaking a car very closely might give you bonus points or charge up a nitro boost.
4.  **Upgrade Your Ride:** Don't hesitate to spend your coins in the garage. Upgrading your bike's speed, handling, and braking will make it much easier to navigate the increasingly heavy traffic in later levels.
