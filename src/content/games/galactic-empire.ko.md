### Overview
RTS‑lite in space: mine resources, expand bases, and assemble fleets to defend and conquer neighboring sectors.

### How to Play
- Build extractors and generators first to stabilize economy.
- Produce a balanced fleet (fighters, frigates, capital ships) and defend chokepoints.
- Capture adjacent nodes to unlock upgrades and map control.

### Controls
- Mouse to select/build; hotkeys for production and camera vary by host.

### Tips
- Queue ships in batches; constant production beats idle docks.
- Scout before pushing; avoid overextending into multiple waves.
- Focus fire on glass‑cannon threats, then clean up.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I get more resources quickly?
A: Expand to nearby nodes and protect extractors; idle miners waste income.
- Q: What fleet composition works best?
A: Mix fast interceptors with heavier ships for structure damage.
- Q: Is there a tech tree in the game?
A: Many hosts gate stronger ships behind captured sectors or upgrades.
