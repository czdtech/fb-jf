### Overview
Google Feud mimics a family‑feud‑style prompt list: you see the beginning of a search query and must guess how users commonly complete it. Each category has multiple top answers with point values. Three wrong guesses end the round, so pattern knowledge and broad guesses win.

### How to Play
- Pick a category; read the prompt stem; type likely completions.
- Start broad (who/what/where) before specific names and brands.
- Watch for plural/singular and regional phrasing.

### Controls
- Keyboard to type answers; Enter to submit; on‑screen buttons for categories.

### Tips
- Think like autocomplete: spellings, synonyms, and common idioms.
- If stuck, try opposites or related concepts.
- Avoid over‑specific proper nouns early.

### FAQ
- Q: How are answers ranked in the game?  
  A: By popularity within the prompt’s dataset; top answers score higher.
- Q: Do typos count as correct answers?  
  A: Common variants may match; exact matching depends on host.
- Q: Can I change the category mid‑round?  
  A: Usually no—finish or fail the current list first.
