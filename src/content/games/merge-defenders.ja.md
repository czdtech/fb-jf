### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Merge Defenders is an exciting and strategic game that blends the addictive nature of merge puzzles with the action-packed gameplay of tower defense. In this game, you must protect your base from relentless waves of enemies. You do this not just by placing towers, but by purchasing basic units, merging two identical units to create a more powerful, higher-level defender, and then strategically deploying them onto the battlefield.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **The Merge Cycle:** The core of the game is the merge mechanic. You start by purchasing level 1 units. Drag a level 1 unit onto another level 1 unit to create a level 2 unit, and so on. Higher-level units have significantly better damage and firing rates.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Deployment:** You have a limited number of slots on your defensive line. Drag your strongest defenders from your reserve grid onto these slots. They will automatically attack any enemies that come into range.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Economy Management:** You earn coins for every enemy you defeat. You must constantly decide whether to spend your coins on more low-level units (to merge up) or to save them for special upgrades that might become available.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Strategic Placement:** Don't just place your strongest unit anywhere. Observe the enemy path. Some slots might be more critical than others, such as at corners where units can cover the path for a longer duration. Place your most powerful defenders in these key positions.
