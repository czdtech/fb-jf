### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Endless Truck is a side‑scrolling stunt runner focused on speed control and landing angles. Hills, ramps, and gaps reward smooth throttle and controlled flips; sloppy landings bleed speed or crash. Cash pickups and missions unlock upgrades (engine, suspension, boost) that raise top speed and stability.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Land flat: Touch down with wheels level to retain speed and avoid bounce.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Throttle feathering: Pulse throttle over crests to prevent nose dives.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Flip discipline: Only flip when altitude and arc are safe; one clean flip beats two risky ones.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Boost wisely: Use nitro on flat exits, not mid‑air; stacking boosts after clean landings yields longest runs.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Upgrade order: Suspension/tires for control, then engine/boost as you stabilize.

### Controls Guide

- Accelerate/Brake: W/S or Up/Down.  Tilt: A/D or Left/Right.  Boost: Shift/Space (varies).

### Advanced Tips

- Pumping: Tap brake before a drop to lower the nose, then accelerate on landing for extra traction.
- Mission routing: Pick routes that complete multiple missions in one run (e.g., flips + distance).
- Crash recovery: If angle is bad, cut throttle and gently tilt to save the landing.
