### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a single line that grows in length. The objective is to eat food items that appear on the screen, making the snake longer with each item consumed. It's a game of skill and foresight, as the primary challenge is to avoid colliding with the outer walls or the snake's own ever-growing body.

### Gameplay Guide
