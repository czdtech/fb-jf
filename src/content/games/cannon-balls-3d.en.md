### Detailed Game Introduction

Cannon Balls 3D is a satisfying physics-based puzzle game where you take control of a powerful cannon to demolish various structures. Each level presents you with a unique building or arrangement of blocks, and your goal is to destroy it using a limited number of cannonballs. Success requires not just good aim, but also a strategic eye for identifying structural weak points to cause maximum collapse with minimum shots.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Analyze the Structure:** Before you fire your first shot, take a moment to examine the building. Look for key support blocks at the base, explosive barrels, or any other potential weak points. The goal is to start a chain reaction.
2.  **Aim for the Foundation:** The most effective strategy is often to destroy the lowest blocks first. Taking out the foundation can cause the entire structure above it to become unstable and collapse on its own, saving you precious ammunition.
3.  **Conserve Your Ammo:** You only have a limited number of cannonballs per level. Make every shot count. Avoid taking potshots at the top of the structure unless it's necessary to hit a specific target.
4.  **Use Special Blocks:** Keep an eye out for special blocks like explosive TNT crates. Hitting one of these can create a large explosion, clearing a significant portion of the structure and saving you multiple cannonballs.

### Controls Guide

The controls are simple and direct.

*   **Aim the Cannon:** Use your mouse to aim. Move it left and right to rotate the cannon, and up and down to set the angle of your shot.
*   **Fire:** Click the left mouse button to fire a cannonball.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: How do I know if I've passed the level?**
    *   **A:** Each level has a goal, often indicated by a horizontal line. You must cause the structure to collapse until all remaining parts are below this line. Once you do, you automatically pass the level.

*   **Q: I ran out of cannonballs but the structure is still too high. What do I do?**
    *   **A:** If you run out of ammunition before meeting the level's objective, you have to restart the level and try a different strategy.

*   **Q: Is it better to shoot fast or aim carefully?**
    *   **A:** Aiming carefully is always better. Since ammunition is limited, a single well-placed shot that causes a major collapse is far more valuable than several random, ineffective shots.
