### Detailed Game Introduction

Emoji With Friends blends quick matching and light deduction using expressive emoji tiles. Depending on mode, you’ll connect sets, complete mini‑goals, or race an opponent to solve boards first. Short rounds, readable visuals, and low barrier to entry make it a friendly party pick.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Scan patterns: Identify frequent emoji sets to build quick chains.
2.  Prioritize objectives: If a round has specific goals, complete them before chasing decorative matches.
3.  Deny opponents (vs): Claim contested tiles early to slow their chains.
4.  Keep the board open: Avoid cluttering the center; leave space for future matches.
5.  Time your boosts: Save power‑ups for tight races or to break board stalls.

### Controls Guide

- Power‑ups (if any): Activate via on‑screen buttons.
- Online/local: Modes vary; many are quick local sessions.
