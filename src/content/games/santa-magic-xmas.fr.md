### Detailed Game Introduction

Santa Magic Xmas is a cheerful and festive match-3 puzzle game that immerses you in the holiday spirit. Your goal is to help Santa Claus by matching colorful Christmas items like bells, ornaments, and gingerbread men. Swap adjacent items to create lines of three or more, trigger powerful combos, and complete the objectives of each level to ensure all the presents are delivered on time!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **Create Festive Power-ups:** The best way to clear the board is by making special items from larger matches.
    *   **[FR]** **Match 4:** Creates a special item that can clear an entire row or column.
    *   **[FR]** **Match 5 (L or T shape):** Creates a wrapped candy bomb that explodes and clears a large area.
    *   **[FR]** **Match 5 (in a line):** Creates a powerful color bomb that can clear all items of a single color from the board.

2.  **[FR]** **Combine for Holiday Cheer:** Swap two special items with each other to unleash a massive, board-clearing effect. This is the key to solving the most challenging puzzles.
3.  **[FR]** **Focus on the Goal:** Each level has a unique objective, such as clearing all the frozen ice tiles or dropping special gift boxes to the bottom. Always prioritize moves that help you achieve the specific goal before you run out of moves.
4.  **[FR]** **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches near the bottom of the board can create cascades, where new items fall and create automatic matches, helping you clear the level more efficiently.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple swap mechanics.

*   **[FR]** **Swap Items:** Click and drag an item to swap it with an adjacent one. The swap will only be successful if it creates a valid match.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[FR]** **Q: What is the most powerful combo?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** Swapping two color bombs together is the most powerful move, as it will clear every single item from the board.
