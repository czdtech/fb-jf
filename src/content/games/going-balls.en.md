<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Going Balls is a tilt‑and‑roll style runner on narrow tracks filled with beams, bumpers, hammers, and moving platforms. Precision matters: small steering inputs maintain balance, while reckless speed sends you off the edge. Stages introduce gimmicks like magnets, ramps, and zip tracks; coins unlock cosmetic balls and continues.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Feather steering to stay centered on beams; brake before sharp turns.
- Time moving obstacles (hammers, pushers) and cross in their recovery windows.
- Collect coins and keys along safer lines—don’t overreach.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- WASD/Arrows or drag to steer; Space/brake where available; R to retry (host dependent).

### Tips
- Look ahead; line up early for narrow entries.
- On steep ramps, build speed first, then steer minimally.
- If you start wobbling, slow down to re‑center.
