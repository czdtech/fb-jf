### Detailed Game Introduction

Fairyland is a low‑stress adventure filled with collectible tasks, simple environmental puzzles, and whimsical scenes. You’ll search for hidden objects, activate switches in the right order, escort little critters, and occasionally complete mini‑games. Progress across compact chapters while enjoying exploration rather than combat.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

2.  **[KO]** Clue notebooks: Note symbol sequences and color orders for later doors.
3.  **[KO]** Optional tasks: Complete side objectives to unlock cosmetic rewards/hints.
4.  **[KO]** Route planning: If a scene has backtracking, collect items along a loop to minimize travel.
5.  **[KO]** Mini‑game focus: Read rules carefully — many allow quick retries without penalty.
