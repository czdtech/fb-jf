### Detailed Game Introduction

Tiletopia is a peaceful and creative city-building puzzle game where you create beautiful, ever-expanding landscapes by placing hexagonal tiles. You start with a single tile and draw from a stack of procedurally generated tiles. The goal is to place these tiles strategically to create a coherent and picturesque world, matching edges like forests, fields, and villages. The game often includes small quests or challenges to guide your creation and maximize your score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Match the Edges:** The fundamental rule is to match the edges of the tiles you place. Connect a forest edge to another forest edge, a field to a field, and so on. Every correct match earns you points.
2.  **Complete Quests:** Pay attention to the quests that appear. These might ask you to create a forest of a certain size, build a village with a specific number of houses, or create a closed loop with a road or railway. Completing these quests is key to a high score.
3.  **Closing Off Areas:** When you completely enclose an area (for example, a field surrounded by roads and houses with no gaps), you often receive bonus points. Look for opportunities to close off these areas.
4.  **Plan Your Placements:** You can see the next few tiles in your stack. Use this information to plan ahead. If you know a specific type of tile is coming up, you can prepare a perfect spot for it.
