### Detailed Game Introduction

Hexa Dungeon is an innovative puzzle-RPG that combines match-3 mechanics with dungeon-crawling combat. In this game, you face off against skeletons and other monsters in a dungeon. To attack your enemies, you must connect chains of three or more identical, adjacent hexagonal tiles on the puzzle board below. The longer the chain you create, the more powerful your attack will be. It's a strategic game where you must balance making powerful attacks with setting up future moves.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **Longer Chains = More Damage:** The core strategy is to create the longest possible chain of matching tiles. A chain of 5 tiles will do significantly more damage than a chain of 3. Always scan the board for the best possible connection before making a move.
2.  **[FR]** **Plan Ahead:** Look at the board and think a few moves ahead. Sometimes, making a smaller match of 3 can position other tiles to allow for a much larger match on your next turn.
3.  **[FR]** **Focus Fire:** In levels with multiple enemies, you can often choose which enemy to target. Focus your attacks on one enemy at a time to defeat them more quickly, reducing the amount of incoming damage you take.
4.  **[FR]** **Special Tiles:** Keep an eye out for any special tiles that may appear on the board. These could be bombs or other power-ups that can be activated by including them in a match, resulting in extra damage or other beneficial effects.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with a simple click-and-drag or swipe mechanic.

*   **[FR]** **Connect Tiles:** Click and hold on a tile, then drag your cursor over adjacent, identical tiles to form a chain. Release the mouse button to confirm the match and launch your attack.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[FR]** **Q: How do I attack the skeletons?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** You attack by making matches on the hexagonal puzzle board. Find a group of at least three connected tiles of the same color and draw a line through them.

*   **[FR]** **Q: How can I do more damage?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** The longer the chain of tiles you connect, the more powerful your attack will be. A 7-tile chain is much stronger than a 3-tile chain.

*   **[FR]** **Q: Can I connect tiles diagonally?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** Yes. Because the board is made of hexagons, you can connect tiles in six different directions to any adjacent, identical tile.
