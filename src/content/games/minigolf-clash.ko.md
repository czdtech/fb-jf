### Detailed Game Introduction

Minigolf Clash is a casual putting game with creative obstacles, ramps, banks, and moving parts. Your goal is simple—finish holes under par—yet mastering angles and pace unlocks low scores and trick‑shot lines.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Pace control: Soft putts around cups prevent lip‑outs; harder hits for uphill ramps.
2.  **[KO]** Clean angles: Use walls to bank at 45° where possible; reduce random ricochets.
3.  **[KO]** Avoid hazards: Favor consistent two‑putts over risky hole‑in‑one attempts.
4.  **[KO]** Learn movers: Time windmills, gates, and pistons; wait for safe windows.
5.  **[KO]** Line rehearsal: Practice putts from similar lies to build reliable muscle memory.

### Controls Guide

- Aim: Drag to set direction.
- Power: Pull back to set strength, release to putt.
- Restart: Use on‑screen control to retry a hole if allowed.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Why do putts rim out? Too much pace or poor line; slow down near the cup.
- Any bank‑shot tips? Aim slightly inside the perfect 45° to account for speed loss.
- How to handle movers? Watch a full cycle first, then commit when timing is clear.
