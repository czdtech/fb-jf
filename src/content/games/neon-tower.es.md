### Detailed Game Introduction

Neon Tower is a fast-paced and addictive 3D arcade game where you guide a bouncing ball down a massive, twisting helix tower. The gameplay is simple to learn but hard to master. You must rotate the tower to find gaps in the platforms, allowing the ball to fall through. The goal is to reach the bottom of the tower while avoiding the deadly red platforms that will end your run instantly.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Find the Gaps:** The core mechanic is rotating the tower to line up the gaps with your bouncing ball. Let gravity do the work and guide the ball downwards.
2.  **[ES]** **Build a Combo for Fireball Mode:** The key to high scores and clearing difficult sections is to build momentum. If you let the ball fall through multiple platforms without touching any of them, it will turn into a fiery projectile. In this "fireball" mode, you can smash through *any* platform, including the red ones, for a short time.
3.  **[ES]** **Risk vs. Reward:** Decide when to play it safe and when to go for a long drop. A long drop can activate fireball mode, but if you misjudge the landing, you might hit a red platform. Sometimes, it's better to make a few smaller, safer drops.
4.  **[ES]** **Look Ahead:** Don't just focus on the platform you are on. Look several levels below to plan your descent and anticipate where the gaps and red platforms will be.

### Controls Guide

The game is controlled with a simple drag mechanic.

*   **[ES]** **Rotate Tower:** Click and hold the left mouse button (or your finger) and drag left or right to rotate the helix tower.
