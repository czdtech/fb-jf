### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Alien Hominid is a fast-paced 2D side-scrolling run-and-gun shooter developed by The Behemoth. It originated as a popular Flash game on the Newgrounds portal in 2002 before being expanded into a full console release for PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Xbox. The game is renowned for its charming, hand-drawn art style by Dan Paladin, its chaotic and challenging gameplay, and its quirky sense of humor.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The premise is simple: players control a small, yellow alien whose UFO has been shot down by the FBI. Now stranded on Earth, the alien must fight its way through waves of secret agents, KGB soldiers, and various bosses to recover its spaceship and escape the planet. The gameplay is heavily inspired by classic arcade shooters like *Contra* and *Metal Slug*, featuring one-hit kills, relentless waves of enemies, and intense boss battles that demand precision and pattern recognition.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Alien Hominid is notoriously difficult. Success relies on reflexes, pattern memorization, and mastering the alien's full moveset.

#### 1. Movement is Survival
*   **Never Stop Moving:** Standing still is the quickest way to die. Always be jumping, running, or rolling to make yourself a harder target.
*   **Master the Roll/Duck:** You can duck under most standard bullets. Tapping the duck button while moving will initiate a roll, which is a fantastic evasive maneuver to dodge incoming fire or quickly reposition.

#### 2. Use Your Full Arsenal
*   **The Power of Digging:** One of the most critical survival skills is the ability to dig underground. While underground, you are completely invulnerable. You can use this to dodge massive bullet storms or to pull enemies underground for an instant kill.
*   **Ride 'Em, Alien!:** You can jump on top of most enemies' heads. From there, you can choose to "ride" them, using them as a human shield, or perform a "chomp" to bite their head off for a stylish kill. This is both a defensive and offensive tactic.
*   **Melee When Necessary:** Your knife is surprisingly effective for close-quarters combat, especially when you are overwhelmed and need to clear space immediately.
*   **Grenades are Your Best Friend:** Grenades deal significant area-of-effect damage. Save them for large groups of enemies or for dealing heavy damage to bosses.

#### 3. General Combat Tips
*   **Charged Shots:** Holding down the fire button charges your blaster for a more powerful shot that can pierce through multiple enemies. However, you cannot move while charging, making you vulnerable. Use it strategically when you have a clear opening.
*   **Prioritize Threats:** Always identify and eliminate the most dangerous enemies first—usually those with rapid-fire weapons or who launch projectiles.
*   **Learn Boss Patterns:** Every boss follows a strict attack pattern. The key to victory is observation. Spend your first few attempts learning their moves and identifying safe spots and attack windows. Don't get greedy; land a few shots and then prepare to dodge again.

### Controls Guide

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Controls can vary slightly between the Flash version and console/HD versions, but the core functions remain the same.

*   **Movement:** Arrow Keys / D-Pad / Analog Stick to move left and right.
*   **Jump:** 'A' Key (Keyboard) / A or X Button (Controller).
*   **Shoot:** 'S' Key (Keyboard) / X or Square Button (Controller). Hold to charge the shot.
*   **Grenade:** 'D' Key (Keyboard) / B or Circle Button (Controller).
*   **Duck/Roll:** Down Arrow Key / Down on D-Pad.
*   **Special Moves:**
    *   **挖掘：** 在松软的地面（泥土、沙子）上按下+跳跃。
    *   **近战攻击：** 靠近敌人并按下射击按钮。
    *   **骑乘/啃咬：** 直接跳到敌人的头顶上。

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: Why is Alien Hominid so difficult?**
    *   **A:** 游戏的高难度是有意为之，旨在模拟经典8位和16位街机游戏的挑战。一击必杀系统要求玩家以近乎完美的执行力进行游戏。

*   **Q: What is the difference between the original Flash game and the HD/console versions?**
    *   **A:** 主机和HD版本得到了极大的扩展。它们具有更多关卡、额外的敌人和Boss、改进的图形和声音、2人合作模式，以及众多迷你游戏和可解锁的外星人帽子。

*   **Q: How do I beat the final boss?**
    *   **A:** 最终Boss是一场多阶段的耐力战。关键是，像所有Boss一样，耐心学习每个阶段的模式。首先专注于躲避，只有在有明确、安全的开口时才进行攻击。

*   **Q: Is *Alien Hominid Invasion* the same game?**
    *   **A:** 不是。*Alien Hominid Invasion*是原作的现代续作和"重新构想"。它具有以合作为重点的非线性游戏玩法，具有Rogue-lite元素、角色进展和不同的机制。这是一款设定在同一宇宙中的新游戏，而不是重制版。
