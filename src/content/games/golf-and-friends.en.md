## English Guide

<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Detailed Game Introduction

Golf and Friends is a casual mini‑golf experience with playful obstacles, ramps, and bank walls. Mastery revolves around pace control and angle selection — soft touches near cups prevent lip‑outs, and 45° bank lines make tight corners consistent. Multiplayer turns the course into a light party game.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Pace near cup: Under‑hit slightly at the rim to avoid lip‑outs.
2.  Bank geometry: Use 45° lines off walls to redirect into narrow lanes.
3.  Hazard timing: Windmills/gates need a full cycle watch.
4.  Two‑putt planning: Don’t force hero shots; set up a gimme second.
5.  Camera work: Pan/zoom to preview hidden slopes.
