### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] "Trap the Cat" is a strategic puzzle game where players must block a clever cat's escape routes by placing barriers on a hexagonal grid, using logic and planning to prevent the cat from reaching the edge. This game tests players' prediction abilities and strategic thinking.

### Gameplay Strategy

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Center Control**: Try to place barriers around the cat first, gradually shrinking its movement area.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Path Analysis**: Observe the cat's possible escape routes and prioritize blocking the shortest paths.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Edge Defense**: Pay attention to protecting the grid edges to prevent the cat from finding breakthrough points.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Predict Movement**: The cat will choose optimal paths; predict its next movement direction.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Encirclement Strategy**: Form a complete encirclement without leaving any escape gaps.

### How to Play

*   **Place Barriers**: Click on hexagonal cells to place obstacles.
*   **Observe Cat**: Watch the cat's current position and possible movement directions.
*   **Restart**: If you fail, you can restart the challenge.



- **Encirclement 戦略**: Form a complete encirclement without leaving any escape gaps.
