### Game Introduction

Tomb of the Mask is a highly addictive, fast-paced arcade game that combines elements of maze navigation and endless runner. Players control a character who moves by swiping, sliding from wall to wall in a pixel-art maze. The primary goal is to collect coins and power-ups while outrunning a constantly rising flood of ink or lava from below.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Movement:** Swipe in any of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Your character will slide in that direction until they hit an obstacle.
- **Collect:** Gather coins and dots scattered throughout the maze.
- **Power-ups:** Pick up various power-ups like shields, speed boosts, or freeze abilities to help you survive.
- **Avoid Obstacles:** Dodge spikes, traps, and enemies.
- **Outrun the Flood:** A colored flood rises from the bottom of the screen, forcing you to move quickly upwards.

### Controls Guide

- **Swipe:** Swipe your finger across the screen (on mobile) or use `Arrow Keys` / `WASD` (on PC) to control your character's movement.
