### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Geometry Dash World distills the core rhythm‑platforming into two themed worlds of brief, tightly designed stages. Each level syncs obstacles to the soundtrack: jump pads and rings propel you over spikes, gravity/size portals transform movement, and ship/ball segments test fine control. Collect orbs and keys to unlock gates, visit daily levels for fresh challenges, and practice sections with checkpoints before committing to a full clear. While shorter than the main series, World emphasizes fast iteration, readable patterns, and score‑chasing with coins and time.

### How to Play
- Tap/jump exactly on beat to clear spikes and saws; hold to pilot ship/ball smoothly.
- Gather orbs/keys to open gates and extra nodes; optional coins add challenge.
- Use practice mode to break difficult sections into repeatable chunks.

### Controls
- Space/Mouse/Touch to jump; hold to fly; practice/checkpoint controls vary by host.

### Tips
- Learn the song’s phrasing—hazards often align with downbeats and fills.
- Keep ship inputs light; release to settle before tight gaps.
- Turn on practice to map tricky ring timings, then execute a clean run.
