### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bricks Breaker Crush fires barrages of balls that ricochet through numbered bricks. Your aim sets the initial trajectory; bricks count down as they’re hit. Mastery is about shaping long ricochet paths, multiplying contacts per volley, and preventing walls from reaching the bottom.
