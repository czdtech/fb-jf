### Detailed Game Introduction

Minesweeper 1000 is a modern take on the classic logic puzzle. Uncover all safe tiles without detonating mines: each revealed number shows how many bombs touch that tile (including diagonals). Larger boards emphasize pattern recognition, fast chording, and safe guessing minimization.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Core patterns: Master 1-2, 1-1, and 1-2-1 edge patterns to place flags deterministically.
2.  Chording: On many builds, clicking a number with all its mines flagged opens surrounding safe tiles; abuse this for speed.
3.  Probability: When forced to guess, choose corners with more unknown neighbors to maximize information.
4.  Frontier focus: Solve along the boundary between known and unknown; avoid random digs deep in fog.
5.  Flag hygiene: Only flag when certain; otherwise keep candidate notes (if the build supports marks).

### Controls Guide

- Left‑click: reveal. Right‑click: flag. Middle/Chord: open around a satisfied number (implementation‑dependent). Quick restart from the menu.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I’m stuck with a 50/50 — what now?
  
  A: Scan for overlooked patterns elsewhere or pick the tile that reveals the largest new frontier if you must guess.

- Q: What does chording do?
  
  A: If a number’s adjacent flags equal its count, chording reveals all its other neighbors at once.

- Q: Any tip for early game?
  
  A: Start in the center to maximize opening cascades; corners give less information.
