### Detailed Game Introduction

Find 500 Differences is a classic puzzle game that puts your attention to detail to the test. Across numerous levels, you will be presented with two beautiful, almost identical images. Your task is to carefully examine them and identify the five subtle differences that set them apart. With a wide variety of pictures, from charming landscapes to complex scenes, the game provides hours of relaxing and engaging fun for all ages.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Scan Systematically:** Don't just randomly look around. Start from the top-left corner and scan both images horizontally, like you're reading a book. This methodical approach ensures you don't miss any sections.
2.  **Focus on Backgrounds and Edges:** Differences are often hidden in plain sight in the background or along the edges of the picture, where players might not look as closely.
3.  **Look for Missing or Added Objects:** The most common type of difference is an object that is present in one image but missing from the other. Scan for these first.
4.  **Check for Color and Shape Changes:** Sometimes the difference is a subtle change in color, size, or shape of an object. Compare similar items in both pictures closely.
5.  **Use Hints Sparingly:** If you get stuck, the game provides a hint system. Try to save your hints for when you are truly stumped to maximize your score and challenge yourself.
