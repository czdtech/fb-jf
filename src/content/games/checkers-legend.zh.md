### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Checkers Legend is a digital version of the classic strategy board game, also known as Draughts. The game is played on an 8x8 checkered board between two opponents. The objective is simple but requires deep strategy: capture all of your opponent's pieces or block them so they have no legal moves left. It's a timeless game of foresight and tactics.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Basic Movement:** Your pieces, or "men," can only move one step diagonally forward onto an empty dark square.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Capturing:** The key to winning is capturing your opponent's pieces. If your piece is diagonally adjacent to an opponent's piece, and the square directly behind that opponent's piece is empty, you *must* jump over and capture it. If your landing position allows for another jump, you must take that one as well in the same turn.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Becoming a King:** When one of your pieces reaches the last row on the opponent's side of the board, it gets "crowned" and becomes a King. Kings are marked with a crown.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **King Power:** Kings are much more powerful because they can move and capture both diagonally forwards and diagonally backwards.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Control the Center:** A good strategy is to control the center of the board. This gives your pieces more mobility and limits your opponent's options.
6.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Protect Your Back Row:** Be careful not to leave your back row (the row closest to you) open for your opponent to easily get a King.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: Do I have to jump if I can?**
     *   **A:** Yes. In most official rules of Checkers, capturing is mandatory. If you have a legal jump available, you must take it.

*   **Q: What makes a King so special?**
     *   **A:** A regular piece can only move forward. A King can move and capture in both forward and backward diagonal directions, making it a much more powerful and flexible piece.

*   **Q: How do I win the game?**
     *   **A:** You win when your opponent has no pieces left, or when all of their remaining pieces are blocked and cannot make a legal move.
