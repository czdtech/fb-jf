### Detailed Game Introduction

6.  **Scoring:** Card values are: Aces = 1, Face Cards (K, Q, J) = 10, Number Cards = face value. After a knock, if your deadwood value is lower than your opponent's, you score the difference. If your opponent's deadwood is lower (an "undercut"), they score the difference plus a bonus.（日本語訳が必要）
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Gin Rummy is a classic two-player card game that belongs to the Rummy family. The objective is to form your hand into valid combinations called "melds"—either sets of the same rank or runs of the same suit. The goal is to score points by having less "deadwood" (unmatched cards) than your opponent when a round ends. It's a game of skill, strategy, and memory, where you must pay close attention to what your opponent discards.

The game is played with a mouse or touch screen.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Discard:** Discard one card from your hand onto the discard pile, placing it face-up.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Knocking:** You can end the round by "knocking" if your deadwood value is 10 or less. To knock, you discard a card and then lay out your melds and deadwood. Your opponent then gets a chance to lay off their own deadwood cards on your melds.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Going Gin:** If you form melds with all 10 of your cards, you can "Go Gin." This results in a bonus, and your opponent is not allowed to lay off any cards.
