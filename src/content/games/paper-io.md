### Game Introduction

"Paper.io" is a popular multiplayer online territory-conquering game. Players control a colored block with the objective of claiming as much territory as possible by drawing lines and enclosing areas. In the game, you need to cleverly expand your territory while being wary of attacks from other players, as your line is your weakness; once touched, you fail. The game is fast-paced, highly strategic, and full of competitive fun.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Safe Expansion**: In the early stages, try to expand within small areas near your territory to ensure safety.
2.  **Quick Action**: When enemy players are far away or distracted, seize the opportunity to quickly claim large areas.
3.  **Protect Your Line**: Your line is your lifeline; be especially careful of other players chasing you while drawing your line.
4.  **Cut Off Enemies**: If an enemy player is expanding their territory by drawing a line, you can eliminate them by cutting off their line.
5.  **Utilize Map Edges**: The edges of the map can also be used as boundaries to enclose areas, which can save time and avoid risks.

### How to Play

*   **Movement**: Typically use the keyboard arrow keys or WASD keys to control your colored block's movement. Your block will automatically draw a line.
