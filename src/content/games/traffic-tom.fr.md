### Commandes

- **Upgrade Your Ride:** Don't hesitate to spend your coins in the garage. Upgrading your bike's speed, handling, and braking will make it much easier to navigate the increasingly heavy traffic in later levels.

- **Close Calls for More Points:** Many driving games reward you for near misses. Safely overtaking a car very closely might give you bonus points or charge up a nitro boost.

- **Focus on Missions:** While surviving is important, completing the missions for each level is how you progress. Pay attention to whether your goal is to overtake a certain number of cars, travel a specific distance, or collect items.

- **Look Ahead:** The key to survival is anticipation. Don't just look at the car directly in front of you; scan far down the road to see traffic patterns forming. This will give you plenty of time to switch lanes safely.
