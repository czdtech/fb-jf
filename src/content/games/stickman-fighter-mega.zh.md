### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Stickman Fighter Mega is a side‑view beat ’em up focused on counter‑timing and spacing. Enemies telegraph swings; punish them with parries, juggles, and area specials. Later waves mix shielded foes, ranged throwers, and heavies that demand varied answers.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Parry window: Learn the parry frame and fish counter‑hits for bonus damage.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Spacing: Fight just outside enemy reach; step in only on swings.

4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Special economy: Save AOEs for multi‑spawn waves.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Combo routes: Light→Heavy→Launcher→Air juggles are high value.
