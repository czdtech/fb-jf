### Overview
Week‑based rhythm battles: match the arrow prompts in time with music to outscore your opponent.

### How to Play
- Focus on accuracy and combo; misses and off‑beat hits drop health.
- Long notes require holding; jacks and doubles appear on higher levels.
- Freeplay allows practicing specific songs.

### Controls
- Arrow keys (or WASD) to hit notes; Enter for menus.

### Tips
- Learn patterns by sound, not just visuals.
- Relax your hands; rolling chords reduce finger jams on jacks.
- Lower visual effects if lag affects timing.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I unlock new weeks?
A: Clear prior weeks or use Freeplay depending on the host.
- Q: Why are my hits late?
A: Adjust input offset in options to match your device latency.
- Q: Can I play custom songs?
A: Some hosts include mods or a custom chart loader.
