### Game Introduction

"OvO Game" is a fast-paced and extremely challenging platformer. Players control a stickman character, using precise jumps, slides, and wall jumps to navigate complex levels, aiming to reach the finish line as quickly as possible. The game is known for its high difficulty and fluid controls, testing players' reaction speed and operational precision.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Master Basic Moves**: Proficiently mastering basic moves like jumping, sliding, double-jumping, and wall-jumping is key to beating the levels.
2.  **Observe Level Layout**: Before attempting, quickly scan the level to plan the general route and techniques to be used.
3.  **Utilize Momentum**: When performing jumps and slides, leveraging the character's momentum can help you jump further or slide more smoothly.
4.  **Practice Repeatedly**: Due to the high difficulty, many levels require repeated attempts to find the optimal way to pass.
5.  **Find Shortcuts**: Some levels might have hidden shortcuts or more efficient ways to complete them; exploration can reveal these.

### How to Play

*   **Slide**: Use the down arrow key or S key to slide, which can be used to pass through narrow passages.
