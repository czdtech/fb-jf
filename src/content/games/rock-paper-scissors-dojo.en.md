### Detailed Game Introduction

Rock Paper Scissors Dojo turns RPS into a light mind‑game. Across best‑of matches, you’ll try to detect tendencies (e.g., opponents repeat after wins, switch after losses) and counter with mixed strategies that avoid being predictable.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Baseline mix: Use a balanced random mix to avoid exploitation early.
2.  Pattern spotting: Track opponent streaks — repeaters vs switchers.
3.  Counter‑adapt: If they repeat after wins, pre‑counter next round; if they switch after losses, anticipate the switch.
4.  Meta resets: Throw an occasional off‑pattern choice to reset reads.
5.  Series math: In best‑of N, tighten play near deciding rounds.
