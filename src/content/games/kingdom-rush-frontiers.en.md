<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Frontiers refines the Kingdom Rush formula with new biomes, enemy abilities, and tower specializations. Place archer, barracks, mage, and artillery towers, then branch them into unique specials. Call reinforcements, drop meteor‑like specials, and micro your hero to plug leaks while managing armor/magic resist counters.

### How to Play
- Identify armor types; use mages vs. armored foes, archers/artillery vs. swarms.
- Position barracks to stall at choke points; support with splash or magic.
- Save hero skills and nukes for elite waves or flying rushes.

### Tips
