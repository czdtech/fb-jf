### Detailed Game Introduction

Unpark Me is a classic sliding block puzzle game, also known as a "parking jam" puzzle. You are presented with a crowded parking lot grid filled with cars and trucks. Your goal is to strategically slide the other vehicles out of the way to clear a path for the target car (usually the red one) to drive out of the exit. The game is a true test of logic and sequential thinking, challenging you to solve the puzzle in the fewest moves possible.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **Identify the Blocker:** First, identify the cars that are directly blocking the red car's path to the exit.
2.  **[DE]** **Work Backwards:** To move the primary blocking car, you often need to move another car that is blocking *it*. Work backwards from the exit, clearing a path piece by piece.
3.  **[DE]** **Use Empty Space:** Efficiently using the empty spaces on the board is crucial. You will need to shuffle cars into temporary empty spots to make room to move the ones you really need to clear.
4.  **[DE]** **Aim for Fewest Moves:** While just solving the puzzle is the main goal, a secondary challenge is to do it in the minimum number of moves. This requires thinking several steps ahead and not making any unnecessary shifts.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple drag-and-drop controls.

*   **[DE]** **Move a Vehicle:** Click and hold on any car or truck. You can only slide it forwards and backwards along its current orientation (either horizontally or vertically). Drag it into an empty space to move it.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: What is the objective?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** To slide the red car out through the exit on the side of the grid.

*   **[DE]** **Q: Why can't I move a car sideways?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** The core rule of the puzzle is that cars can only move in the direction they are facing (forwards and backwards). They cannot be turned or moved sideways.

*   **[DE]** **Q: I'm completely stuck. What can I do?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** Most versions of the game include a hint button that will show you the next correct move. If you're out of hints, you may need to use the reset button to start the level over with a fresh perspective.
