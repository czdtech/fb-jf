### Detailed Game Introduction

Droid-O is a compact, responsive top‑down arena shooter where you pilot a nimble robot through tightening survival waves. The core loop revolves around clean kiting (moving while firing without getting cornered), ammunition/overheat discipline, and situational ability use (dashes, shields, deployables). Enemies escalate from slow melee units to faster chargers and ranged threats that punish predictable paths. Success comes from carving safe orbits around the arena, thinning high‑pressure clusters first, and timing cooldowns to escape pinch points.

The arena often includes environmental features — choke corridors, pillars for line‑of‑sight breaks, and hazard tiles that deal damage or slow both you and enemies. Efficient use of cover and terrain is as important as raw aim, especially once ranged enemies spawn.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Kite wide, not tight: Large circular paths give more correction time than small, panicky loops.
2.  Target priority: Eliminate fast chargers and ranged casters first; leave slow melee for cleanup.
3.  Cooldown discipline: Save dash/shield to break encirclements; avoid blowing both escapes at once.
4.  Ammunition/heat: Fire in short, accurate bursts; re‑engage while weapons cool or reload behind cover.
5.  Funnel fights: Pull packs through narrow lanes so bullets pierce multiple targets; reset aggro lines with pillars.
6.  Health economy: Take guaranteed safe shots; a single hit during late waves snowballs mistakes.

### Builds and Synergies (if available)

- Piercing + knockback: Piercing bullets gain huge value in choke fights; knockback keeps melee out of contact.
- Slow + crit: Apply slows to create long exposure times for crit bursts.
- Drone deployables: Drop drones before kite turns so they rake pursuing lines.

### Controls Guide

- Move: `WASD`/Arrows.  Aim: `Mouse` or right stick.  Fire: `Left click`/trigger.  Dash/Ability: `Space`/E/Q (varies by build).
- Pause/Retry: UI buttons.

### Advanced Tips

- Pathing: Pre‑plan a figure‑eight route that revisits ammo/health pickups on cooldown.
- LOS breaks: Step behind a pillar to force ranged foes to reposition, buying reload time.
- Wave pacing: Throttle kill speed briefly to lump spawns together, then clear them with pierce lines.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:droid-o:i-keep-getting-cornered-how-6205b082 -->
  Q: I keep getting cornered — how do I prevent this?
  
  A: Stop circling tightly near walls. Commit to wide arcs that cross the arena center, dash early through thinnest gaps, and use pillars to reset lines of sight.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:droid-o:which-enemies-should-i-kill-1787e5bd -->
  Q: Which enemies should I kill first?
  
  A: Fast chargers and ranged units. Slow melee can be kited safely while you thin priority targets.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:droid-o:my-weapon-overheats-constantly-19a29573 -->
  Q: My weapon overheats constantly — any fix?
  
  A: Fire in short bursts, reposition during cooldown, and stack efficiency upgrades if the mode supports them.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:droid-o:are-deployables-worth-it-039fa7d3 -->
  Q: Are deployables worth it?
  
  A: Yes — pre‑place them along your kite path so they fire as enemies chase, multiplying damage without extra risk.
