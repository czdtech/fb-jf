### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3D drift racer: earn points by maintaining controlled slides, invest earnings into car upgrades and tuning (suspension, camber, turbo), and unlock new tracks and cars.

### How to Play
- Chain drifts without hitting obstacles; multipliers build with clean, long slides.
- Tune gear ratios and suspension to match track layout and style.
- Spend credits on better tires, turbo, and weight reduction.

### Controls
- WASD/Arrows steer/throttle; Space: handbrake; C: camera; R: reset (host may vary).

### Tips
- Feather throttle mid‑drift to avoid spinning out.
- Use handbrake taps to initiate on low‑speed corners.
- Practice donut control to learn throttle/steering balance.

### FAQ
- Q: Is there damage?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Visual only on many hosts; collisions break combos.
- Q: Best starter upgrades?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Tires first, then power and weight.
- Q: Can I tune per track?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Yes; save presets for technical vs. high‑speed maps when supported.
