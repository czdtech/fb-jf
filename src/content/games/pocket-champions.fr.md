### Detailed Game Introduction

Pocket Champs is an idle multiplayer racing game where you don't directly control the race, but you control everything that leads to victory. Your role is to train your "Champ" in various disciplines like running, flying, and climbing. Before each race, you must strategically equip your Champ with the right gadgets for the course. Once the race begins, you watch as your preparation pays off and your Champ competes automatically to bring home the win.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **Train, Train, Train:** The foundation of your success is training. Keep your Champ training at all times to level up their running, flying, climbing, and swimming skills. This is an idle game, so training continues even when you are offline.
2.  **[FR]** **Match Gadgets to the Race:** Before a race begins, you will see a preview of the track. Pay close attention to the obstacles. If you see a lot of water, equip the flippers. If there's a big climbing wall, equip the climbing picks. Choosing the right gadget for the right obstacle is the most important strategic decision you make.
3.  **[FR]** **Watch and Learn:** Although the races are automatic, watch them to see where your Champ is struggling. Are they slow on the running sections? Are they losing time on the climbs? This will tell you what skills you need to focus on training next.
4.  **[FR]** **Collect Your Rewards:** Winning races earns you chests and currency. Be sure to open these to get new gadgets and the resources needed to upgrade your Champ and existing gear.

### Controls Guide

The game is played through a series of menus.

*   **[FR]** **Training:** Click on the training section and select the skill you want your Champ to work on.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[FR]** **Q: How do I control my character during the race?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** You don't! The race is fully automatic. Your job is to prepare your Champ *before* the race through training and gadget selection.

*   **[FR]** **Q: How do I win more races?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** By having better stats and strategy than your opponents. Make sure your Champ's training levels are high and that you are choosing the correct gadgets that counter the obstacles in the upcoming race.

*   **[FR]** **Q: What is the best gadget?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** There is no single "best" gadget. The best one is always the one that matches the next major obstacle on the track. A speedboat is useless on a running track, but essential on a water track.
