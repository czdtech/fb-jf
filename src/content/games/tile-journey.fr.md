### Rappel de gameplay

Fonctionnement proche de Tile Guru : choisis des tuiles accessibles, envoie‑les

### Commandes

- **Look Before You Leap:** Before placing a tile in the tray, make sure you have a plan for it. If you put a tile in the tray that you can't match soon, it will just take up valuable space.

- **Use the Tray as a Holding Area:** You don't have to complete a set of three immediately. You can use the tray to temporarily hold tiles while you work to uncover the third one you need. For example, if you have two identical tiles in the tray, you can pick up other tiles while you search for the third matching one.

- **Plan Ahead:** Don't just click on the first three matching tiles you see. Look at the tiles underneath. Prioritize clicking tiles that will uncover the most new tiles, giving you more options for future moves.

- **The Golden Rule:** The collection tray is limited (usually to seven slots). If you fill it completely without making a match, you lose. Every move must be made with this in mind.
