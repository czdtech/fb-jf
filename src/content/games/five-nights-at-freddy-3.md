### Overview
Set in a horror attraction years later, you face Springtrap while phantoms disrupt your systems. Manage cameras, audio lures, and ventilation.

### How to Play
- Use the audio lure to draw Springtrap away; avoid overusing it on cooldown.
- Seal vents along his path to block shortcuts.
- Reboot systems (video, audio, ventilation) when errors occur to restore control.

### Controls
- Mouse/UI for cameras, audio, vent seals, and system reboots.

### Tips
- Keep Springtrap in rooms far from your office; lure step‑by‑step.
- Phantoms are distractions—avoid staring at them; recover and re‑establish control quickly.
- Prioritize ventilation errors; long blackouts invite failures.

### FAQ
- Q: Why does the audio stop working during a lure?  
  A: The audio system overheats or errors; reboot it from the maintenance panel.
- Q: How do I prevent Springtrap from entering the office?  
  A: Chain lures and pre‑emptively seal vents on his likely routes.
- Q: Which system should I reboot first when multiple fail?  
  A: Ventilation to stabilize view/effects, then video/audio as needed.
