### Game Introduction

Super Smash Flash is a legendary fan-made fighting game inspired by the official Super Smash Bros. series. It brings together a diverse roster of characters from various video game and anime franchises into a 2D platform-fighting arena. The game is celebrated for its fast-paced action and capturing the spirit of the original console games in a free-to-play Flash format.

### Gameplay Guide

The objective is not to deplete a health bar, but to increase your opponent's damage percentage and launch them off the screen. The higher a character's percentage, the farther they will fly when hit.
- **Damage:** Attack opponents to increase their damage percentage (%).
- **Smash Attacks:** Use powerful "smash" attacks to send high-damage opponents flying off the stage.
- **Recovery:** If you are knocked off the stage, use your character's jumps and special moves to get back onto the platform.
- **Items:** Items will periodically appear on the stage, which can be used to gain an advantage.

### Controls Guide

The game can be played by two players on the same keyboard.
- **Player 1:**
    - **Move:** Arrow Keys
    - **Jump:** `O`
    - **Attack:** `P`
- **Player 2:**
    - **Move:** `A`, `S`, `D`, `W` (W for jump)
    - **Attack:** `F`
    - **Special Move:** `G`
- **Pause:** `Backspace`

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How do I win a match?**

You win by having the most KOs (or the last remaining lives, depending on the game mode) when the match ends. The key is to knock other players off the screen.

**How do I perform different attacks?**

Combine the attack button (`P` or `F`) with directional keys. For example, pressing `Up Arrow` + `P` will perform an up-attack. Experiment with different combinations on the ground and in the air to discover all of your character's moves.

**Is this an official Nintendo game?**

No, Super Smash Flash is a non-profit fan-made project created by McLeodGaming. It is a tribute to the Super Smash Bros. series.
