### Overview
Getting Over It is a precision physics climb where you control only a hammer. By swinging, pogoing, and hooking the hammer, you haul a man in a cauldron up cliffs, towers, and precarious ledges. The design embraces loss: a small mistake can drop you back minutes—or hours—forcing you to rebuild progress. Mastery comes from learning anchor spots, momentum arcs, and gentle mouse angles rather than brute force.

### How to Play
- Plant the hammer on stable edges before pushing; quick flicks create pogo launches.
- Chain swings to convert horizontal motion into vertical lift.
- After falls, reset your rhythm—rushing causes repeat mistakes.

### Controls
- Mouse controls hammer angle and force; minimal keyboard use (host dependent).

### Tips
- Use gentle circular motions for controlled swings; avoid jerky inputs.
- Identify safe anchor “pockets” before committing to big moves.
- Practice notorious sections (Devil’s Chimney, Orange, Towers) until muscle memory forms.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I stop sliding off edges?  
  A: Keep the hammer slightly below the lip to maintain friction and stability.
- Q: What is the fastest way past the early chimney?  
  A: Small pogo hops with controlled angles are safer than risky full launches.
- Q: Can I lose all progress with one mistake?  
  A: Yes, large falls are part of the design; patience is the core skill.
