### Overview
The third entry sharpens platforming with trickier timing windows, moving hazards, and additional secret routes. Expect switch puzzles, hidden keys, and off‑screen passages that reward careful exploration and efficient routing.

### How to Play
- Clear main exits first, then return for secrets and time medals.
- Use moving platforms to set up longer jumps.
- Track which keys open which doors to avoid backtracking.

### Controls
- Arrows/WASD move/jump; attack/interact per host.

### Tips
- Stay patient on moving hazards—missing one cycle costs less than a death.
- Route coins/items only if they don’t risk the timer.
- Listen for audio cues hinting at hidden areas.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I find hidden exits in this game?  
  A: Check ceilings, false walls, and off‑screen ledges; look for slight tile seams.
- Q: Are there difficulty spikes compared to part 2?  
  A: Jumps are tighter and hazards denser; practice specific rooms.
- Q: Can I replay levels quickly for medals?  
  A: Yes—menus often support fast restarts for routing attempts.
