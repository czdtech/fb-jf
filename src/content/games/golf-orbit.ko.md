### Detailed Game Introduction

Golf Orbit turns golf into a physics flight puzzle. You’ll pick a launch angle and power, then watch your ball arc across varied terrain and planetary bodies. Spin and bounce behavior, wind, and occasional gravity wells add depth: the best shots ride slopes, skim obstacles, and chain bounces to reach hidden targets.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Angle discipline: Shallow launches maximize roll; higher arcs clear hazards but lose rollout.
2.  **[KO]** Spin control: Apply backspin to stick on small islands; topspin to ride downhill slopes for extra distance.
3.  **[KO]** Gravity/wind: Aim slightly upwind; use gravity wells to slingshot if present.
4.  **[KO]** Terrain reads: Plan for first bounce, not just landing; slopes redirect momentum.
5.  **[KO]** Par routing: Take safe two‑shot lines rather than risky one‑shot clears until consistent.

### Controls Guide

- Tap to start the power bar; tap again to set power/angle; apply spin via swipe (if supported).

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My ball always overshoots — how to fix?

A: Lower the launch angle and reduce power; use backspin to stop on small greens.

- Q: What’s the best all‑around angle?

A: Medium‑low angles (25–35°) with topspin for roll are consistent on open holes.

- Q: Do gravity wells actually help?

A: Yes — enter on a tangent to slingshot outward with speed; practice the timing.
