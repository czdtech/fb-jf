### Detailed Game Introduction

Carrom Clash is a realistic digital version of the beloved tabletop "strike and pocket" game, Carrom. Often described as finger billiards, the game challenges you to use a larger disc, the "striker," to flick your set of assigned pieces (either black or white) into the four corner pockets. The game requires precision, strategy, and a good understanding of angles to outmaneuver your opponent and clear your pieces first.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Objective:** Be the first player to pocket all of your pieces (black or white). To win, you must also pocket and "cover" the red Queen.
2.  **Pocketing Your Pieces:** On your turn, you shoot the striker from your baseline. If you successfully pocket one of your own pieces, you get to shoot again.
3.  **The Queen:** The red Queen is a special piece. You can pocket it any time after you've sunk your first piece. However, to secure the points for the Queen, you *must* sink one of your own pieces immediately on the very next shot. This is called "covering the Queen."
4.  **Fouls:** Be careful not to pocket your striker! This is a foul and results in a penalty, where one of your already pocketed pieces is returned to the center of the board.
5.  **Bank Shots:** Use the sides of the board to your advantage. Bouncing the striker off the edges can help you hit pieces that are in difficult positions.
