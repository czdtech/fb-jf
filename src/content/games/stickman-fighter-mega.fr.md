### Detailed Game Introduction

Stickman Fighter Mega is a side‑view beat ’em up focused on counter‑timing and spacing. Enemies telegraph swings; punish them with parries, juggles, and area specials. Later waves mix shielded foes, ranged throwers, and heavies that demand varied answers.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Parry window: Learn the parry frame and fish counter‑hits for bonus damage.
2.  **[FR]** Spacing: Fight just outside enemy reach; step in only on swings.
3.  **[FR]** Target priority: Delete ranged/fast daggers first; kite heavies.
4.  **[FR]** Special economy: Save AOEs for multi‑spawn waves.
5.  **[FR]** Combo routes: Light→Heavy→Launcher→Air juggles are high value.

### Controls Guide
