## Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bloons TD (Tower Defense) is a highly popular series of tower defense games. The core premise is straightforward yet engaging: players must prevent waves of balloons, known as "Bloons," from traversing a set path and reaching the exit. To do this, players strategically place a variety of "monkey towers" along the path.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Each monkey tower has unique abilities, attack styles, and upgrade paths. Popping Bloons earns the player in-game money, which can be used to buy more towers or purchase powerful upgrades for existing ones. The game's challenge escalates as the rounds progress, introducing tougher and more complex Bloon types.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Key features of the series include:
The game is primarily controlled via mouse or touch screen, making it very intuitive.（日本語訳が必要）
-   **Diverse Bloons:** Starting from simple red Bloons, players will face multi-layered Bloons (blue, green, yellow, etc.), fast-moving ones, and Bloons with special properties like **Camo** (invisible to most towers), **Lead** (immune to sharp projectiles), **Regrow** (regenerate layers if not popped quickly), and **Fortified** (extra tough).
    - **Camo Detection:** A Ninja Monkey, a Sniper Monkey with the right upgrade, or a Monkey Village with Radar Scanner is essential.（日本語訳が必要）
    - **Crowd Control:** Towers that excel at popping large groups of Bloons, like the Tack 撃つer, Bomb Shooter, or Wizard Monkey, are crucial for dense waves.
    - **MOAB Damage:** As you approach later rounds, you need high-damage towers specifically for MOAB-class Bloons. Super Monkeys, Spike Factories, and certain high-tier upgrades are designed for this.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Map Placement Matters:** Place towers where they can cover the most track. Bends and intersections are ideal spots. Place long-range towers like Sniper Monkeys where they have a clear line of sight across the map.（日本語訳が必要）
**1. Why are my towers not attacking certain Bloons?**（日本語訳が必要）
- **Invest in Economy:** On harder maps and modes, generating extra income is vital. Banana Farms are towers dedicated solely to producing more money each round, allowing you to afford the most expensive and powerful upgrades.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Placing a Tower:** Select a tower from the UI panel (usually on the right or bottom of the screen). Drag it to a valid position on the map and release to place it.（日本語訳が必要）
## コントロール Guide
- **Upgrading a Tower:** Click on a tower you have already placed on the map. This will bring up its upgrade menu. If you have enough money, you can click on an available upgrade to purchase it.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Using Abilities:** Some tower upgrades grant activated abilities. These will appear as buttons in the tower's menu or at the bottom of the screen. Click them to activate their effect.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Hotkeys (PC):** Most towers and upgrades are bound to hotkeys (e.g., Q for Dart Monkey, comma and period for upgrades), allowing for very fast placement and upgrading for experienced players.（日本語訳が必要）
## Frequently Asked Questions (よくある質問)
- **Tower Synergy is パワーful:** Some towers are designed to boost others. The Monkey Village can provide buffs like increased attack speed and range to all towers within its radius. An Alchemist can throw potions that dramatically increase the damage and attack speed of a nearby tower. Combining these is a core part of high-level strategy.
-   **Massive Blimps:** The ultimate threats are the MOAB-class Bloons (Massive Ornary Air Blimp), which are enormous blimps that absorb huge amounts of damage and release smaller Bloons upon being popped.
    - **MOAB Damage:** As you approach later rounds, you need high-damage towers specifically for MOAB-class Bloons. Super Monkeys, Spike Factories, and certain high-tier upgrades are designed for this.（日本語訳が必要）
-   **Deep Upgrade System:** Most towers have three distinct upgrade paths. Players can only upgrade two of these paths on a single tower, leading to a vast number of strategic combinations and specialized tower roles.
> - **ZOMG** (black blimp): Contains 4 BFBs.（日本語訳が必要）
- **DDT** (fast, black blimp): Has Camo, Lead, and Black Bloon properties, making it very dangerous.（日本語訳が必要）
-   **Heroes:** Special, powerful units that level up automatically during a game, providing unique abilities that can turn the tide of a difficult round.
- **BAD** (purple blimp): The toughest blimp in the game, contains ZOMGs and DDTs.（日本語訳が必要）
**3. What is the "best" tower in the game?**（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The goal is to survive all the rounds on a given map and difficulty without losing all your lives.

## Gameplay Strategy

-   **Early Game is Key:** Start with cost-effective towers. A few upgraded Dart Monkeys or a Tack Shooter placed on a sharp corner can handle the initial waves cheaply, allowing you to save money for more powerful defenses later.
-   **Create a Balanced Defense:** Do not rely on just one type of tower. Your defense must be able to handle all Bloon types. By mid-game, ensure you have:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Camo Detection:** A Ninja Monkey, a Sniper Monkey with the right upgrade, or a Monkey Village with Radar Scanner is essential.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Lead Popping Power:** Bomb Shooters, Mortar Monkeys, or towers with specific upgrades (e.g., a Boomerang Monkey's Red Hot Rangs) are needed for Lead Bloons.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Crowd Control:** Towers that excel at popping large groups of Bloons, like the Tack Shooter, Bomb Shooter, or Wizard Monkey, are crucial for dense waves.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **MOAB Damage:** As you approach later rounds, you need high-damage towers specifically for MOAB-class Bloons. Super Monkeys, Spike Factories, and certain high-tier upgrades are designed for this.
-   **Tower Synergy is Powerful:** Some towers are designed to boost others. The Monkey Village can provide buffs like increased attack speed and range to all towers within its radius. An Alchemist can throw potions that dramatically increase the damage and attack speed of a nearby tower. Combining these is a core part of high-level strategy.
-   **Map Placement Matters:** Place towers where they can cover the most track. Bends and intersections are ideal spots. Place long-range towers like Sniper Monkeys where they have a clear line of sight across the map.
-   **Invest in Economy:** On harder maps and modes, generating extra income is vital. Banana Farms are towers dedicated solely to producing more money each round, allowing you to afford the most expensive and powerful upgrades.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Why are my towers not attacking certain Bloons?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > This is usually due to special Bloon properties. If a Bloon is green with a camo pattern, it's a **Camo Bloon**, and only specific towers or towers with a "camo detection" upgrade can see it. If it's a grey, metallic Bloon, it's a **Lead Bloon**, and it's immune to sharp projectiles like darts and tacks. You need explosive or magical attacks to pop it.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. What is a MOAB, BFB, ZOMG, DDT, or BAD?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > These are all "MOAB-class" blimps that appear in later rounds. They are extremely durable and move slowly. From weakest to strongest:
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > - **MOAB** (blue blimp): Contains 4 Ceramic Bloons.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > - **BFB** (red blimp): Contains 4 MOABs.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > - **ZOMG** (black blimp): Contains 4 BFBs.
- **DDT** (fast, black blimp): Has Camo, Lead, and Black Bloon properties, making it very dangerous.
- **BAD** (purple blimp): The toughest blimp in the game, contains ZOMGs and DDTs.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. What is the "best" tower in the game?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > There is no single "best" tower. The strength of Bloons TD lies in its balance and synergy. A tower that is amazing in one situation might be useless in another. The best strategy is to build a diverse team of towers that support each other and cover all weaknesses.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. How do I make more money?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > The primary way is by popping Bloons. For a significant income boost, build and upgrade Banana Farms. Some other towers, like the Alchemist or Monkey Buccaneer, also have upgrade paths that generate money.


    - **Lead Popping Power:** Bomb 撃つers, Mortar Monkeys, or towers with specific upgrades (e.g., a Boomerang Monkey's Red Hot Rangs) are needed for Lead Bloons.
    - **Crowd Control:** Towers that excel at popping large groups of Bloons, like the Tack 撃つer, Bomb Shooter, or Wizard Monkey, are crucial for dense waves.
