### Overview
One‑button drifting on a floating track: tap/hold to drift at corners, release to straighten, and stay on the platform to bank coins for vehicle upgrades.

### How to Play
- Anticipate corner entry; press to start a drift, release to exit.
- Narrow platforms and bumps require shorter, snappier holds.
- Coins unlock cars with better traction or stability.

### Controls
- Mouse/Space/Touch: hold to drift; release to go straight.

### Tips
- Look ahead for S‑bends; use micro‑taps instead of long holds.
- Don’t over‑correct—falling usually comes from late releases.
- Spend early on stability to survive longer tracks.

### FAQ
- Q: Is there braking?  
  A: No manual brake—timed holds manage angle and speed through corners.
- Q: Do cars handle differently?  
  A: Yes—higher tiers offer grippier or more forgiving drift windows.
- Q: How to farm coins faster?  
  A: Chain long runs and complete daily/track challenges when present.
