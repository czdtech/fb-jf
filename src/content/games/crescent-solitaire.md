### Overview
Crescent Solitaire is a two‑deck patience game played with 16 tableau piles arranged in a semicircle (“crescent”) around eight foundations: one Ace and one King of each suit. The goal is to build Ace foundations up in‑suit to King and King foundations down in‑suit to Ace. Tableau builds allow up or down by suit and can wrap around (King after Ace and vice‑versa). Empty spaces are not filled. After you exhaust moves, a redeal moves the bottom card of every tableau pile to the top; you usually get three redeals per game. When the two foundations of a suit are in sequence, you may transfer cards between them (not the base Ace/King). 

### How to Play
- Move available top cards from the tableau to foundations, following suit and direction.  
- Build tableau piles up or down in suit to uncover useful cards; wrapping is allowed.  
- Use foundation transfers (same‑suit in sequence) to free blocked cards.  
- When stuck, press Redeal to cycle each tableau pile’s bottom card to the top; up to three redeals.  

### Controls
- Mouse/touch: select or drag cards; tap buttons for Undo/Hint/Redeal (as provided by the host site).  
- No stock to draw from; progress depends on tableau manipulation and timely redeals.  

### Tips and Strategies
- Build evenly across suits so no single suit stalls both of its foundations.  
- Before using a redeal, expose as many helpful top cards as possible.  
- Prefer moves that release buried low cards for Ace stacks and high cards for King stacks.  
- After a redeal, re‑scan all piles; valuable cards often rotate into play.  

### FAQ
- Q: How many redeals are allowed?  
  A: Standard Crescent allows three redeals (four deals total).  
- Q: Can empty spaces be filled?  
  A: No. Spaces in the tableau are not filled in Crescent.  
- Q: What is “foundation transfer”?  
  A: If the Ace and King foundations of a suit are in sequence, you may move one or more top cards between them (excluding the base Ace/King) to continue building.
