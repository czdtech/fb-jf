### Detailed Game Introduction

Secret Agent blends stealth with light puzzle routing. You’ll disable cameras, avoid cones of vision, hack doors, and collect intel before extraction. Clean routes and gadget timing trump brute force.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Vision cones: Move only when guard cones sweep away.
2.  **[DE]** Gadget economy: Save EMPs/decoys for multi‑guard rooms.
3.  **[DE]** Route layering: Clear side intel when it’s along the optimal path; skip deep detours.
4.  **[DE]** Sound bait: Throw a decoy to pivot patrol routes, then slip through.
5.  **[DE]** Fail forward: After detection, break line of sight and hide; don’t panic sprint.

### Controls Guide
