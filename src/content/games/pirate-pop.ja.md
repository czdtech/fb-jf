### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pirate Pop is a fun and addictive bubble shooter game with a swashbuckling pirate theme. Your goal is to clear the screen of colorful bubbles by firing your cannon and matching three or more bubbles of the same color. Aim carefully, use the walls to make tricky bank shots, and create large chain reactions to drop big clusters of bubbles and claim the pirate treasure!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
