### Game Introduction

YoHoHo.io is a fast-paced, pirate-themed battle royale .io game where players compete to be the last pirate standing on a shrinking island. Starting as a small pirate, you must collect gold, grow in size and strength, and eliminate other players to dominate the leaderboard. The game combines simple controls with addictive, competitive gameplay.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Collect Gold:** Your primary objective is to collect gold scattered around the island. Gold increases your pirate's size, attack range, and damage.

- **Shrinking Map:** The safe zone on the island continuously shrinks, forcing players closer together and increasing the intensity of battles. Stay within the safe zone to avoid taking damage.
- **Dash Ability:** Use your dash ability strategically to quickly close distances, escape danger, or dodge attacks.
