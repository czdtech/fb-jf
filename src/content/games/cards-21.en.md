### Detailed Game Introduction

Cards-21 is a quick blackjack variant: draw cards to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. Face cards count as 10; aces can be 1 or 11. Some modes include multi‑hand play, insurance, or side bets.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Basic odds: Stand on hard 17+; hit 11 or lower; consider doubling on 10–11 versus weak dealer cards.
2.  Soft hands: With an ace counted as 11, hit more liberally; convert to hard when needed.
3.  Dealer upcard: Adjust risk based on dealer’s visible card (2–6 weak, 7–A strong).
4.  Bankroll: Use flat bets; avoid chasing losses.
5.  Side bets: Fun but higher house edge — play sparingly.
