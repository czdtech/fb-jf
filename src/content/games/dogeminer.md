### Overview
DogeMiner is an incremental idle/clicker game themed around mining coins. Click to mine manually, buy pickaxe upgrades and helpers (such as Shibes, statistics‑boosting tools, and factories), and automate production to earn faster. Later goals include traveling to the Moon and beyond with rocket upgrades. 

### How to Play
- Click to earn initial coins; invest in upgrades that increase coins per click and per second.  
- Purchase helpers/buildings to automate income; compounding production unlocks new tiers.  
- Use prestige or late‑game resets (where available) to gain multipliers for future runs. 

### Controls
- Mouse/touch: click for manual mining; use UI buttons to buy upgrades, helpers, and rockets. 

### Tips and Strategies
- Reinvest early into passive income before chasing expensive prestige or rocket parts.  
- Maintain a balance between click upgrades and idle buildings based on playtime.  
- Save for milestone buildings that unlock new content (e.g., space travel). 

### FAQ
- Q: Is it playable offline?  
  A: Some hosts save progress locally and generate coins while the tab is open; full offline progress varies by host.   
- Q: What’s the long‑term goal?  
  A: Build enough production to launch rockets to the Moon and progress to later areas.
