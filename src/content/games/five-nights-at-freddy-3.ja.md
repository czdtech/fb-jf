### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Set in a horror attraction years later, you face Springtrap while phantoms disrupt your systems. Manage cameras, audio lures, and ventilation.

### How to Play
- Use the audio lure to draw Springtrap away; avoid overusing it on cooldown.
- Seal vents along his path to block shortcuts.
- Reboot systems (video, audio, ventilation) when errors occur to restore control.

### Controls
- Mouse/UI for cameras, audio, vent seals, and system reboots.

### Tips
- Keep Springtrap in rooms far from your office; lure step‑by‑step.

- Prioritize ventilation errors; long blackouts invite failures.
