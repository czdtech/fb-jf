### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Word Search is a classic and beloved word puzzle game. The objective is to find and mark all the words hidden inside a grid of letters. A list of words is provided, and players must scan the grid to locate them. The words can be placed horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, and can be spelled forwards or backwards, making it a fun challenge for your observation skills.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Scan Systematically:** Don't just look randomly. Scan the grid row by row, both forwards and backwards, for the first letter of a word on your list. Then do the same for each column.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Look for Uncommon Letters:** If a word has an uncommon letter like J, Q, X, or Z, scan the entire grid for that letter first. Since it appears less frequently, it will significantly narrow down the possible locations for that word.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Check All Directions:** Remember that words can be hidden in any of the eight directions. Once you find the first letter of a word, check all adjacent letters to see if they continue the word in any direction.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Use Hints When Needed:** If you're truly stuck on a word, don't be afraid to use a hint if the game provides one. It will usually reveal the location of the word you're looking for.
