### Game Introduction

    - **Splitting Switches (`<>`):** When the block lies flat across this switch, it splits into two smaller, independent 1x1 cubes.（日本語訳が必要）
    - For `X` switches, you need to plan your moves to land your block in a standing position precisely on the switch.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Splitting 戦略:** When your block is split into two cubes, they move in parallel. You can press the Spacebar to toggle control between them.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bloxorz is a challenging 3D puzzle game where the objective is to maneuver a 1x2x1 rectangular block through a series of floating platforms and into a square hole at the end of the stage. The challenge lies in navigating the block by rolling it, ensuring it doesn't fall off the edges of the platforms.
    - To merge the two cubes back into a single block, they must be positioned right next to each other (adjacent squares). 移動する one into the other to reform the block.
- **Use Edges to Your Advantage:** Sometimes, you'll need to use the edge of a platform as a pivot point to get your block into a standing position where you otherwise couldn't. This is an advanced technique required for later levels.（日本語訳が必要）
The controls are simple and based on the keyboard's arrow keys.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game consists of 33 stages, each progressively more difficult and introducing new mechanics and obstacles. To complete a level, the block must be standing upright (occupying a single 1x1 square) to fall perfectly into the 1x1 destination hole.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The puzzle elements evolve through the introduction of special tiles and switches:
-   **Fragile Tiles (Orange):** These tiles will collapse if the block stands upright on them, as its entire weight is concentrated on a single square. The block must lie flat (distributing its weight over two squares) to safely cross them.
    - Use one cube as an anchor or a block to manipulate the position of the other.（日本語訳が必要）
**1. Why did I fall through the orange floor?**（日本語訳が必要）
- **Write Down レベル Codes:** The game provides a unique code for each level. Write these down so you don't have to start from the beginning every time you play.
- **Up Arrow Key:** Roll the block forward.（日本語訳が必要）
### コントロール Guide
- **Down Arrow Key:** Roll the block backward.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Left Arrow Key:** Roll the block to the left.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Right Arrow Key:** Roll the block to the right.（日本語訳が必要）
- **Spacebar:** Switch control between the two smaller cubes after splitting.（日本語訳が必要）
### Frequently Asked Questions (よくある質問)
    - **Soft Switches (`()`):** Activated when any part of the block touches them.（日本語訳が必要）
-   **Switches:** There are three types of switches that control bridges and platforms.
    - For `X` switches, you need to plan your moves to land your block in a standing position precisely on the switch.（日本語訳が必要）
    - For `()` switches, you can simply roll over them.（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Soft Switches (`()`):** Activated when any part of the block touches them.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Hard Switches (`X`):** Can only be activated when the block is standing upright on them, applying its full weight.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   **Splitting Switches (`<>`):** When the block lies flat across this switch, it splits into two smaller, independent 1x1 cubes.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Think and Plan Ahead:** Bloxorz is a game of foresight. Before making a move, visualize the next few rolls. Count the squares to see where your block will land and in what orientation (standing or lying flat). Rushing will almost always lead to falling off.
-   **Master the Fragile Tiles:** The rule is simple but crucial: **Never stand on an orange tile.** Always ensure your block is lying flat when any part of it is resting on a fragile tile.
-   **Understand the Switches:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     -   For `()` switches, you can simply roll over them.

### Controls Guide

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The controls are simple and based on the keyboard's arrow keys.

-   **Up Arrow Key:** Roll the block forward.
-   **Down Arrow Key:** Roll the block backward.

-   **Right Arrow Key:** Roll the block to the right.
-   **Spacebar:** Switch control between the two smaller cubes after splitting.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Why did I fall through the orange floor?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > You fell because your block was standing upright on the orange tile. These tiles are fragile and can only support the block when it's lying flat, distributing its weight across two squares.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. The 'X' switch is not working. What am I doing wrong?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > The 'X' switch is a "hard" or "heavy" switch. It requires the full, concentrated weight of the block to activate. You must position the block so it is standing vertically on top of the 'X' tile. Lying flat on it will not work.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. How do I get my two small blocks back together?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > To merge the two cubes back into the original block, you must move them so they are on adjacent squares (side-by-side). Then, select one cube and move it into the other. They will automatically combine.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. How can I return to a level I've already reached?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] > After completing each level, the game provides a 6-digit passcode. You can enter this code on the main menu screen to start directly from that level.
