### Detailed Game Introduction

Minigolf Clash is a casual putting game with creative obstacles, ramps, banks, and moving parts. Your goal is simple—finish holes under par—yet mastering angles and pace unlocks low scores and trick‑shot lines.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Pace control: Soft putts around cups prevent lip‑outs; harder hits for uphill ramps.
2.  Clean angles: Use walls to bank at 45° where possible; reduce random ricochets.
3.  Avoid hazards: Favor consistent two‑putts over risky hole‑in‑one attempts.
4.  Learn movers: Time windmills, gates, and pistons; wait for safe windows.
5.  Line rehearsal: Practice putts from similar lies to build reliable muscle memory.
