<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Set in a horror attraction years later, you face Springtrap while phantoms disrupt your systems. Manage cameras, audio lures, and ventilation.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Use the audio lure to draw Springtrap away; avoid overusing it on cooldown.
- Seal vents along his path to block shortcuts.
- Reboot systems (video, audio, ventilation) when errors occur to restore control.

<!-- i18n:section:controls -->
### Controls
- `Mouse`/UI for cameras, audio, vent seals, and system reboots.


<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Tips
- Keep Springtrap in rooms far from your office; lure step‑by‑step.
- Phantoms are distractions—avoid staring at them; recover and re‑establish control quickly.
- Prioritize ventilation errors; long blackouts invite failures.
