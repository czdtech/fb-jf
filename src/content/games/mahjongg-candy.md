### Game Introduction

Mahjongg Candy is a sweet and engaging tile-matching puzzle game that puts a colorful, candy-themed spin on the classic Mahjongg Solitaire. The objective is to clear the entire board by finding and matching identical pairs of candy tiles. It's a game that tests your observation skills, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking.

### Gameplay Guide

- **Matching Pairs:** Click or tap on two identical candy tiles to remove them from the board.
- **Unblocked Tiles:** Only tiles that are "unblocked" can be matched. An unblocked tile must have at least one free side (left or right) and no other tile on top of it.
- **Time Limit:** Most versions of the game have a time limit, so you need to think and act quickly.
- **Strategy:** Look for matches that will free up more tiles, especially those that are blocking other tiles. Don't just match the first pair you see.
- **Scoring:** Longer chains of matches or faster completion often lead to higher scores. Some tiles might offer score multipliers.

### Controls Guide

- **Mouse/Touch:** Use your mouse or finger to click/tap on the tiles to select them.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What is the goal of Mahjongg Candy?**

The main goal is to clear all the candy tiles from the board by matching identical, unblocked pairs.

**What happens if I get stuck?**

Many Mahjongg games offer hints that can reveal a possible match, or a shuffle option to rearrange the remaining tiles if no moves are available. Using these might incur a score penalty.

**How can I improve my game?**

Practice recognizing patterns and planning your moves several steps ahead. Prioritize clearing tiles that are blocking many other tiles. Try to create cascades of matches.
