### Detailed Game Introduction

Emoji Fun is a creative and thought-provoking puzzle game based on associations. In each level, you are presented with two columns of emojis. Your task is to figure out the relationship between them and draw lines to connect the correct pairs. The connections can be literal (like a sock and a foot) or conceptual (like a ghost and a haunted house). It's a fun test of your logic and lateral thinking.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** **Find the Obvious Pairs First:** Start by scanning for the most direct and obvious connections. Matching pairs like "peanut" and "elephant" or "honey" and "bee" will help you narrow down the remaining options.
2.  **[ES]** **Think Abstractly:** Not all pairs are literal. You might need to think about what things are used for, where they come from, or what they represent. For example, you might connect a book to a library or a crown to a king.
3.  **[ES]** **Process of Elimination:** Once you have connected a few pairs, you will have fewer emojis left on each side. Use the process of elimination to help you figure out the final, more difficult connections.
4.  **[ES]** **No Time Pressure:** This is a relaxing game. Take your time to think about the relationships between the images.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with a simple drag-and-drop mechanic.

*   **[ES]** **Connect Emojis:** Click and hold on an emoji in one column, then drag your finger or mouse to the related emoji in the other column to draw a connecting line.
