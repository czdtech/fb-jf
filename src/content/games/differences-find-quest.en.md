### Detailed Game Introduction

Differences Find Quest challenges you to compare two images and spot subtle changes: missing objects, color swaps, flipped patterns, or size variations. Later levels add more differences, trick angles, and gentle time pressure.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Grid scan: Divide the image into 4–6 zones and sweep each zone methodically.
2.  Look for edges: Differences cluster at borders, shadows, and repeated textures.
3.  Zoom if possible to check small details.
4.  Save hints for the final 1–2 stubborn differences.
5.  Take short breaks to reset your visual focus.

### Controls Guide

- `Tap` differences on either image; wrong taps may cost time.
- Use hints sparingly; some modes penalize excessive hints.
