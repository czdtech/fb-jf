<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
The original training‑and‑racing sim: raise a duck’s running, swimming, and flying stats via mini‑games, then win races to progress through areas.

<!-- i18n:section:how-to-play -->
### How to Play
- Train each skill to meet race demands; feed seeds to boost energy.
- Replay training stages to raise caps; races require balanced stats.
- Earn coins to buy seeds and cosmetics.

### Controls
- Arrows/Space or mouse depending on mini‑game.

### Tips
- Balance stats rather than grinding only one.
- Watch race previews to see which skills matter most.
- Keep energy high; it’s effectively endurance.
