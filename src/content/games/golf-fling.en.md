### Detailed Game Introduction

Golf Fling is a fun and challenging physics-based puzzle game that reinvents the way you play golf. Instead of clubs, you use a simple pull-and-release mechanic to fling the golf ball across a variety of creative and tricky courses. Your goal is to get the ball into the hole in as few flings as possible. Navigate around obstacles, use the terrain to your advantage, and master the art of the fling to become a champion!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Aim Carefully:** Before you fling, an indicator line will show you the projected path of your ball. Use this to aim precisely, taking into account any obstacles or slopes.
2.  **Control Your Power:** The further you pull back before releasing, the more power your shot will have. You'll need to learn how to judge the right amount of power for both long drives and short, delicate chips.
3.  **Use the Environment:** The courses are filled with slopes, walls, and other features. Use them to your advantage! Bounce the ball off walls to get around corners or use a ramp to launch your ball over a gap.
4.  **Plan Your Shots:** Some holes can't be completed in a single shot. Look at the entire level and plan a route for your ball. Sometimes you need to land in a specific spot to set up your final shot on the hole.
5.  **Strive for Pars:** Each level has a par, which is the expected number of flings to get the ball in the hole. Try to meet or beat the par for the highest score.

### Controls Guide

*   **Aim and Power:** Click and hold the mouse button on the golf ball. Drag your mouse back to set the power and direction of your shot.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **Q: What is the goal of the game?**
    *   **A:** The goal is to get the golf ball into the hole on each level using the fewest number of flings possible.
