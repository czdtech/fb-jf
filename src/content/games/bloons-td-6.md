### Game Introduction

Bloons TD 6 is the latest and most expansive installment in the acclaimed tower defense series. The game elevates the classic formula with full 3D graphics, a host of new mechanics, and an unprecedented level of strategic depth. The objective remains to strategically place and upgrade monkey towers to prevent waves of "Bloons" from reaching the exit.

The game fundamentally changes the upgrade system by giving each tower **three distinct upgrade paths**. A single tower can be upgraded to Tier 5 on one path, and up to Tier 2 on another path (e.g., a 5/2/0 or 5/0/2 build), but the third path remains locked. This system creates an immense variety of specialized roles for every tower.

**Major New Features of Bloons TD 6:**
-   **Heroes:** Players choose a powerful Hero to place on the field. Heroes level up automatically throughout the game, unlocking devastating new abilities without costing any in-game money. Each Hero has a unique playstyle.
-   **Three Upgrade Paths & Tier 5s:** The addition of a third path and powerful Tier 5 upgrades for every monkey provides a massive increase in strategic options.
-   **Monkey Knowledge:** A persistent meta-progression tree where players spend points earned from leveling up to grant small but significant permanent buffs to their towers.
-   **New Bloon Types:** Introduces the **Purple Bloon** (immune to energy, fire, and plasma attacks) and the ultimate blimp, the **B.A.D.** (Big Airship of Doom), which is incredibly durable and releases ZOMGs and DDTs when popped.
-   **Line of Sight:** For the first time, 3D objects on the map can block the line of sight of certain towers, adding a new layer to placement strategy.
-   **Paragons:** The ultimate late-game towers. By having all three Tier 5 towers of a single monkey type on the field, you can sacrifice them to create an immensely powerful Paragon version of that monkey.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Synergy is King:** BTD6 is all about tower combinations. The most famous synergy is pairing a strong damage tower (like a 2/0/3 Super Monkey) with a 4/2/0 **Alchemist** (Stronger Stimulant), which provides a massive boost to damage and attack speed.
-   **Choose the Right Hero:** Your Hero can define your strategy.
    -   **Sauda:** Excellent for maps with single choke points or sharp corners, dominating the early game.
    -   **Benjamin:** A non-attacking hero who generates large amounts of money and strengthens your economy.
    -   **Geraldo:** A "shop" hero who provides a versatile toolkit of items for any situation.
-   **Mastering the Threats:**
    -   **Camo:** The best all-around solution is a x/2/x **Monkey Village** (Radar Scanner) to grant camo detection to all nearby towers.
    -   **Lead:** Many towers can handle lead, but an Alchemist is a great support option as its acid can allow sharp-damage towers to pop them.
    -   **Purple:** These require physical projectiles. Avoid relying solely on magic-users like the Wizard Monkey or Super Monkey's plasma path.
    -   **DDTs:** These are the ultimate test. They are fast and have Camo, Lead, AND Black Bloon properties. Key counters include a 2/5/0 **Wizard Monkey** (Prince of Darkness), a 0/2/5 **Ice Monkey** (Icicle Impale), or granting lead-popping power to camo specialists via a x/3/x **Monkey Village** (Monkey Intelligence Bureau).
-   **Build a Strong Economy:** Banana Farms are still the best way to generate money. The 2/3/0 `Marketplace` path provides hands-free income, while the 4/2/0 `Central Market` path is highly efficient for large-scale farming.
-   **Plan for Paragons:** In extreme late-game or Boss Events, Paragons are your win condition. To get a high-degree Paragon, you need to sacrifice as many towers of that type as possible, have a high pop count on them, and invest a lot of money into the final upgrade.

### Controls Guide

The controls are intuitive for PC (mouse) and mobile (touch).

-   **Placing/Upgrading:** Select a tower from the panel, place it on the map. Tap/click the tower to open its three-path upgrade menu.
-   **Hero Abilities:** Your Hero's abilities appear above their level indicator. Click them to activate.
-   **Tower Abilities:** Activated abilities for regular towers appear in the bottom-left corner of the screen.
-   **Hotkeys (PC):** Each monkey tower and its upgrades are assigned a hotkey (e.g., Q for Dart Monkey, 1/2/3 for upgrade paths). This allows for extremely fast gameplay for experienced players.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is the best Hero to start with?**
> **Sauda** is widely considered the most beginner-friendly Hero. She is relatively cheap and can single-handedly beat the first 20-30 rounds on most beginner maps, allowing you to focus on building your economy.

**2. How do I beat DDTs? They are destroying my defense.**
> DDTs require a multi-faceted defense. You need towers that can see camo, pop lead/black, and have high damage. A Monkey Village with **Monkey Intelligence Bureau (x/3/x)** is invaluable, as it lets all nearby towers damage any Bloon type. Pair this with high-damage towers like a 2/0/5 Tack Shooter or a 0/2/5 Perma-Spike factory.

**3. Why can't I damage the Purple Bloons?**
> Purple Bloons are immune to energy, plasma, fire, and magic-based attacks. This includes many upgrades from the Wizard Monkey and Super Monkey. You must use towers that fire physical projectiles, like a Crossbow Master (Dart Monkey 0/2/5) or a Juggernaut (Dart Monkey 5/x/x).

**4. How do I make a Paragon?**
> To create a Paragon, you must first have all three Tier 5 towers of a single monkey type (e.g., all three Tier 5 Dart Monkeys) placed on the map. Once you do, the upgrade button on any of them will change to a Paragon upgrade. The power of the Paragon depends on factors like the number of towers sacrificed, their total pop count, and money invested.

**5. What is CHIMPS mode?**
> CHIMPS is the hardest game mode in BTD6. It's an acronym for the rules: **N**o **C**ontinues, **N**o **H**earts Lost, **N**o **I**ncome (other than popping Bloons), **N**o **M**onkey Knowledge, **N**o **P**owers, and **N**o **S**elling. It is the ultimate test of a player's strategy.
