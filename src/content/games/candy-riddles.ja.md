### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Candy Riddles is a colorful match‑3 puzzler where you swap adjacent candies to form lines of three or more. Matches clear tiles, charge power‑ups, and can free trapped cells or collect mission items. As stages progress, blockers (e.g., frosting, crates), limited moves, and special goals require planning and efficient cascades.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Work from the bottom to generate natural cascades that clear more tiles for free.
