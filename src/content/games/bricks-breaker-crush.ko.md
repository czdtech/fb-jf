### Detailed Game Introduction

Bricks Breaker Crush fires barrages of balls that ricochet through numbered bricks. Your aim sets the initial trajectory; bricks count down as they’re hit. Mastery is about shaping long ricochet paths, multiplying contacts per volley, and preventing walls from reaching the bottom.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** Shallow angles: Start at modest angles to maximize side‑to‑side hits.
2.  **[KO]** Target multipliers: Hit +ball pickups early to scale your volleys.
3.  **[KO]** Cut columns: Remove high‑value columns that threaten the bottom.
4.  **[KO]** Set traps: Build V‑shaped lanes so balls loop near the top for extended time on target.
5.  **[KO]** Emergency clears: When a row is critical, aim direct shots to neutralize it before it drops.
6.  **[KO]** Power‑ups: Save line clears for emergencies; chain with big volleys when possible.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to aim; release to fire the volley.
- Power‑ups trigger on catch or tap depending on the build.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: My shots feel too random—how do I get control?

A: Use modest angles and shape lanes that keep balls looping near the ceiling; avoid steep, chaotic caroms.

- Q: What should I prioritize: +ball or clears?

A: Early +ball pickups snowball; in danger, clear critical columns first.

- Q: The wall keeps dropping—any fix?

A: Stop building traps and fire surgical shots at the highest numbers near the bottom edge.
