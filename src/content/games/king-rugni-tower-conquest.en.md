King Rugni Tower Conquest is a streamlined tower defense. Place and upgrade towers to counter varied enemy types, manage limited gold, and shape paths (if possible) to maximize kill zones.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Coverage first: Place towers to cover long paths and shared choke points.
2.  Mixed damage: Combine single‑target and splash to handle waves and elites.
3.  Early upgrades: A few well‑upgraded towers often beat many weak ones.
4.  Path shaping: If routing exists, force longer paths through kill zones.
5.  Economy: Don’t over‑float gold—invest early for compounding value.
