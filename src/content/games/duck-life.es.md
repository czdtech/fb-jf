### Overview
The original training‑and‑racing sim: raise a duck’s running, swimming, and flying stats via mini‑games, then win races to progress through areas.

### How to Play
- Train each skill to meet race demands; feed seeds to boost energy.
- Replay training stages to raise caps; races require balanced stats.
- Earn coins to buy seeds and cosmetics.

### Controls
- Arrows/Space or mouse depending on mini‑game.

### Tips
- Balance stats rather than grinding only one.
- Watch race previews to see which skills matter most.
- Keep energy high; it’s effectively endurance.

### FAQ
- Q: Can I skip races?
A: Progression typically requires winning set races per area.
- Q: Do cosmetics help?
A: Purely visual; training and energy drive results.
- Q: Are there level caps?
A: Early areas cap stats until later unlocks.
