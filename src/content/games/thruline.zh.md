### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Thruline tasks you with tracing one unbroken path that visits all required nodes while obeying rules about turns, crossings, and coverage. Later grids add gates, bridges, and parity tricks that reward early bottleneck placement.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Bottlenecks first: Claim narrow corridors before they close.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Turn budgeting: Minimize turns on long runs; save them for tight corners.

5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Symmetry exploitation: Mirror partial solutions in symmetric layouts.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to draw; undo/clear via UI; some builds show conflict highlights.
