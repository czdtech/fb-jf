### Présentation

Même base match‑3, mais avec un habillage animaux : chaque niveau te demande de collecter certains symboles ou d’atteindre un score pour « sauver » ou aider des petites créatures.



    - **A:** If you don't complete the level's objective before your moves run out, you will lose a life and have to restart the level.

- **Q: What happens if I run out of moves?**

    - **A:** The rainbow pet (from matching 5 in a line) is extremely useful for clearing many pets of one type. However, the best play is often to combine two power-ups for a major board-clearing effect.

- **Q: What is the best power-up to create?**

    - **A:** You must make a match that includes the caged pet. This will break the cage and free the pet.

- **Q: How do I get past the locked or caged pets?**

### Foire aux questions (FAQ)

- **Swap Pets:** Click and drag a pet to swap it with an adjacent one. The swap will only be successful if it creates a valid match.


    - **Plan Your Swaps:** With a limited number of moves, every action counts. Look for swaps that will create a chain reaction or set up a powerful combo on your next turn.

    - **Focus on the Objective:** Always keep the level's goal in mind. If you need to break ice blocks, make matches next to them. If you need to collect a certain number of a specific pet, prioritize those matches.

    - **Combine Boosters:** The most powerful moves in the game come from swapping two special pets next to each other. This triggers a massive combo effect that can clear a huge portion of the board at once.

- **Match 5 (in a line):** Creates a rainbow pet that can clear all pets of a single type from the board.

- **Match 5 (L or T shape):** Creates a bomb pet that explodes and clears a block of surrounding pets.

- **Match 4:** Creates a special pet that can clear an entire row or column.
The game is played with simple swap mechanics.
