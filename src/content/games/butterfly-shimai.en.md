### Detailed Game Introduction

Butterfly Shimai is a captivating and relaxing puzzle game that combines elements of Mahjong and connect-2 mechanics. The game presents you with a board filled with beautiful butterfly wings. Your objective is to find and connect pairs of identical wings to make them form a complete butterfly and fly away, clearing the board. The challenge lies in the connection rule: wings can only be paired if a path can be drawn between them with no more than two turns, and without passing through any other wings. With a time limit for each level, you need to be quick and strategic to clear all the butterflies.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Scan for Obvious Matches:** Start by looking for pairs of wings that are directly adjacent or have a clear, straight path between them. These are the easiest to clear and will open up the board.
2.  **Prioritize Edges and Corners:** Wings located on the edges and corners of the board are often easier to connect as they have fewer blocking tiles around them. Clearing these first can create more opportunities.
3.  **Look for Two-Turn Paths:** Remember the connection rule: a path can have up to two turns. Visualize these paths to find less obvious matches.
4.  **Use Hints Wisely:** If you get stuck, the game usually provides a hint button. Use it when you're truly stumped, but try to solve puzzles on your own to improve your observation skills.
5.  **Time Management:** Keep an eye on the timer. Making matches adds a small amount of time back, so quick and continuous matching is key to completing levels.

### Controls Guide

*   **Select and Connect:** Use your `mouse` to `click` on the first butterfly wing, then `click` on its identical matching wing. If a valid path exists, the butterflies will fly away.
