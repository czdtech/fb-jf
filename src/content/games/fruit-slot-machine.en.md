### Detailed Game Introduction

Fruit Slot Machine emulates a simple three‑reel slot with classic fruit symbols and occasional bonus features. Each spin is independent; payouts follow the paytable and active paylines. Treat it as light entertainment rather than a strategy game.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Budget first: Set a session budget; don’t chase losses.
2.  Paytable: Learn which symbols and lines pay most; features trigger rarely.
3.  Bet sizing: Use modest, consistent bets to extend playtime.
4.  Breaks: Take short breaks to avoid impulse overbets.
5.  Stop rules: Quit on reaching a win target or budget floor.

### Controls Guide

- Set bet/lines (if offered) and press Spin; Auto‑spin optional.
