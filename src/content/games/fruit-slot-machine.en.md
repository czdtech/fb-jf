### Detailed Game Introduction

Fruit Slot Machine emulates a simple three‑reel slot with classic fruit symbols and occasional bonus features. Each spin is independent; payouts follow the paytable and active paylines. Treat it as light entertainment rather than a strategy game.

4.  Breaks: Take short breaks to avoid impulse overbets.
