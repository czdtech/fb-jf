### Overview
This Henry Stickmin episode revolves around a branching airship break‑in. You pick gadgets (disguises, grapples, tech toys) and follow route splits that lead to success or hilarious failure. Quick‑time prompts appear in action scenes, while a scene map lets you revisit to collect all fails and endings.

### How to Play
- Select tools at decision points; timing matters in chase sequences.
- Explore the major branches to see unique endings.
- Use scene select (if available) to finish collections.

### Controls
- Mouse to choose; occasional keys for QTEs depending on host.

### Tips
- Don’t fear failure—each wrong pick teaches the right path.
- Click characters mid‑scene to log bios when supported.
- Keep a list of endings to avoid repeats.

### FAQ

  A: Multiple branch‑specific endings; exact count depends on the host version.
