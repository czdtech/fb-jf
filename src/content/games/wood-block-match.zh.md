### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Wood Block Match is a 10×10‑style block placement game with wooden aesthetics. Each turn you receive a batch of shapes; place them to complete rows/columns and clear space. The session ends when none of the remaining pieces fit — so success is about preserving flexible lanes while engineering multi‑line clears.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Center breathing room: Keep the board center open; tidy edges to prevent single‑cell traps.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Pocket planning: Reserve a 2×2 or L‑shaped pocket for awkward triominoes.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Hard piece first: When crowded, place the largest/most awkward piece first.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Double clears: Build two‑line setups so one piece clears both.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Undo discipline: If available, undo immediately after a placement that seals pockets.

### Controls Guide

- Drag pieces into the grid; rotate if the mode supports it; clear rows/cols score points.
