### Detailed Game Introduction

Cat Sort Quest adapts the popular sort‑puzzle format: each perch holds a stack of cats in different colors. You may move only the top cat from a perch, and you can place it on an empty perch or one whose top cat matches the same color. The goal is to end with each perch holding a single color. Limited free perches make buffering and foresight essential.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Keep one buffer empty as long as possible to enable reshuffles.
2.  Finish colors early when it frees another perch (snowball effect).
3.  Surface singles: Don’t bury unique colors under mixed stacks.
4.  Two‑step preview: Simulate next moves to avoid creating softlocks.
5.  Merge partial stacks of the same color promptly to release space.

### Controls Guide

- Tap a perch to pick up its top cat; tap a destination perch to place it if legal.
- Undo/Reset if available; hints help on late puzzles.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I’m out of moves — what now?
  
  A: Undo a few steps to reopen a buffer. Focus on surfacing buried singles and merging partial stacks.

- Q: Is there an optimal order to complete colors?
  
  A: Prioritize colors that immediately free a perch, then target the tallest mixed stacks.

- Q: Do I need every move perfect?
  
  A: No — quick backtracks and flexible buffers are more important than perfection.
