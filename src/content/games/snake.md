### Game Introduction

Snake is a classic arcade game where the player controls a single line that grows in length. The objective is to eat food items that appear on the screen, making the snake longer with each item consumed. It's a game of skill and foresight, as the primary challenge is to avoid colliding with the outer walls or the snake's own ever-growing body.

### Gameplay Guide

The core mechanic is simple: guide the snake to eat the food. As the snake eats, it gets longer, and often, its speed increases, making navigation progressively harder. The game ends when the snake hits an obstacle. Your goal is to achieve the highest score possible by eating as much food as you can before a collision occurs.

### Controls Guide

The controls are typically straightforward:
- **Arrow Keys:** Use the Up, Down,Left, and Right arrow keys to direct the snake.
- **WASD Keys:** Many versions also support `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` as an alternative for movement.
- **Pause:** The `Spacebar` can often be used to pause and resume the game.
