### Detailed Game Introduction

Tile Puzzle is a modern and engaging tile-matching game that challenges your planning and strategic skills. The goal is to clear a board stacked with various patterned tiles. You do this by selecting a tile and sending it to a collection tray at the bottom. When you have three identical tiles in the tray, they match and disappear, freeing up space. You must clear the entire board to win, but be careful—if you fill the tray completely, you lose!

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Think Before You Tap:** The collection tray has a very limited capacity (usually seven slots). Before you tap a tile, have a plan for it. Don't just tap random tiles hoping for the best.
2.  **[KO]** **Uncover New Tiles:** Your primary goal should be to make matches that uncover the most new tiles. Sometimes it's better to hold off on an easy match if it doesn't reveal any new, useful tiles underneath.
3.  **[KO]** **Use the Tray as a Temporary Hold:** You can place tiles in the tray that don't yet form a match. Use this to your advantage. If you need a specific tile that is currently blocked, you can move other tiles into the tray to hold them while you work on freeing up the one you need.
4.  **[KO]** **Identify Trapped Tiles:** Look for situations where one tile type is stacked directly on top of another of the same type. You will need to clear the top one first, which means you'll need to find its two other partners while the one below remains blocked.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple clicks or taps.

*   **[KO]** **Select a Tile:** Click on any tile that is not grayed out (i.e., not covered by another tile) to move it to the collection tray at the bottom of the screen.
