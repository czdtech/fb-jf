<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Crosswords are letter grids solved by filling Across and Down entries that match numbered clues. In American‑style crosswords, every letter is cross‑checked by an intersecting word and grids typically have 180° rotational symmetry; common sizes are 15×15 on weekdays and 21×21 on Sundays.

### How to Play
- Click a clue or cell, then type letters to fill the entry.  
- Use cross letters to confirm uncertain answers and resolve ambiguities.  
- Many web versions include tools such as Check/Reveal, timers, and navigation shortcuts.

### Controls
- Type A–Z; arrow keys move between cells; Backspace deletes; Enter/Tab often switches direction or jumps to the next clue (site‑dependent). 

### Tips and Strategies
- Start with easy clues (fill‑in‑the‑blank, plural/tense markers) to get crossings.  
- Fill long theme entries after gaining letters from nearby answers.  
- Learn common abbreviations and clue conventions used by American‑style grids.
