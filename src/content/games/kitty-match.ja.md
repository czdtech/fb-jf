### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Kitty Match is a charming and addictive match-3 puzzle game filled with cute cats and colorful challenges.

By completing levels, you can earn rewards and progress through a delightful, cat-filled world. It's a relaxing game for all ages, perfect for puzzle and cat lovers alike.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Look for Big Matches:** While matching three items is good, matching four or five items is even better! These larger matches create special power-up tiles that can clear entire rows, columns, or explode to clear a whole area.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Plan Your Moves:** You only have a limited number of moves in each level. Before making a swap, look at the whole board and try to plan a few moves ahead. Prioritize matches that will help you achieve the level's goal.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Combine Power-ups:** The real magic happens when you combine two special power-up tiles. Swapping a bomb with a rocket, for example, can create a massive board-clearing effect. Experiment with different combinations.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches at the bottom of the board can cause a cascade of new tiles to fall, often creating new matches automatically. This is a great way to clear the board efficiently.
