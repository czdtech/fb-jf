### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Egg Maker distills time‑management cooking into rapid stations: crack, whisk, season, heat, plate, and serve. Each order specifies a style (scrambled, sunny‑side, omelet) and doneness windows. Items on heat continue cooking, so sequencing and pickup timing decide whether you hit “perfect” or burn.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Station rhythm: Always start with the longest step (heat), then backfill short prep while the pan runs.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Two‑pan flow: Stagger pans by a few seconds so you can flip/plate one while prepping the next.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Doneness windows: Grab at the edge of “perfect” for score bonuses; learn visual/audio tells.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Multi‑orders: Group similar styles to reuse pan state and reduce clean cycles.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Upgrades: Prioritize extra pan and faster prep over décor.

### Controls Guide

- Tap to crack/whisk/season; drag to pan/plate; tap customer to serve.
- Pause/Retry in the UI between shifts.

### Advanced Tips

- Buffer trays: Stage plates near the pass so you spend less movement when orders spike.
- Early cancel: If an item overcooks, toss quickly to keep flow rather than serve a penalty.
- Combo routing: Serve 2–3 dishes back‑to‑back for a tip multiplier.
