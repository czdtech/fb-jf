### Detailed Game Introduction

3D Free Kick focuses on set‑piece mastery: pick a target, curve around the wall, and beat the keeper. Stages vary wall size, keeper reactions, distance, and wind to test precision and shot shaping.

<!-- i18n:section:tips -->
### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Target corners: High/low corners are hardest to reach for keepers.
2.  Add controlled curve: Apply just enough spin to clear the wall and dip inside the post.
3.  Read wind: Offset your aim and spin according to wind direction/strength (if present).
4.  Mix heights: Flat drives for close range; dipping shots for longer walls.
5.  Learn keeper tells: Some keepers step early—fake lines and bend late.
