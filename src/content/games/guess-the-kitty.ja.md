### Overview
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Guess the Kitty is a light quiz where you identify cat breeds or features from photos and prompts. Rounds may include multiple‑choice, fill‑in, or timed modes. Accuracy and streaks raise your score; hints cost points.

### How to Play
- Study visible traits (ear shape, coat pattern, color points, tail length).
- Eliminate unlikely options before committing.
- Use hints sparingly; save them for near‑misses.

### Controls
- Mouse/touch to select answers; keyboard for text entries when applicable.

### Tips
- Learn hallmark patterns (tabby M‑mark, tortoiseshell mottling, color‑point masks).
- Compare head/ear silhouette to narrow families.
- Don’t rush timed modes—streak bonuses outweigh one fast guess.
