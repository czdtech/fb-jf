### Overview
Descent is a minimalist vertical skill game where you drop down a shaft, time jumps off walls, and avoid hazards like spikes and moving traps. Many web versions use one‑button or two‑button controls to leap from wall to wall while gravity pulls you downward. 

### How to Play
- Tap/click to jump from the current wall to the opposite side; chain jumps to pass gaps.  
- Read obstacle timing (moving spikes/platforms) and wait for safe windows.  
- Collectibles may award points or unlock cosmetics depending on the host. 

### Controls
- Mouse/touch: tap to jump; some versions use Left/Right or A/D to leap off the respective wall. Controls vary slightly by host. 

### Tips and Strategies
- Don’t rush: small delays often desync hazards and create openings.  
- Jump earlier for longer lateral travel; later for short, steep hops.  
- Use wall‑cling moments to scout the next two screens ahead.  

### FAQ
- Q: Is progress endless or level‑based?  
  A: Hosts vary; some are endless score chases, others have stage checkpoints.   
- Q: Are there power‑ups?  
  A: Some versions add shields or slow‑mo; availability depends on the host.
