### Detailed Game Introduction

Idle Restaurants is a classic idle management game that puts you in charge of building a culinary empire from the ground up. You start with a small, humble diner and must strategically invest your earnings to grow your business. By upgrading your tables, chefs, and waiters, you can increase your efficiency and profits. The ultimate goal is to automate your workflow by hiring managers and expand your enterprise by opening new, more profitable restaurants.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **The Restaurant Workflow:** Understand the flow of money. Customers arrive and are seated -> The chef prepares their order -> The waiter delivers the food -> The customer pays. Each step in this chain can be upgraded.
2.  **[FR]** **Balanced Upgrades:** To maximize your income, you need a balanced operation. It's no use having super-fast chefs if you don't have enough tables for customers, or if your waiters are too slow to deliver the food. Try to upgrade your tables, kitchen, and waiters in tandem.
3.  **[FR]** **Automate Everything:** The key to an idle game is making money while you're away. As soon as you can, hire managers for each station. The manager will automatically collect earnings for you, ensuring a constant stream of income.
4.  **[FR]** **Know When to Expand:** Your long-term goal is to save up enough money to open a new restaurant. Each new restaurant you unlock will have a much higher earning potential than the last. Once upgrades in your current restaurant become very expensive, it's time to focus on saving for the next one.

### Controls Guide

The entire game is played by clicking or tapping on various buttons.

*   **[FR]** **Upgrade:** Click the upgrade buttons associated with the tables, the chef's station, or the waiters to improve their level and efficiency.
*   **[FR]** **Hire Manager:** Click the manager icon for a station to hire them and automate that station's process.
*   **[FR]** **Navigate:** Use the world map or restaurant list to switch between your different restaurant locations.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[FR]** **Q: What is the fastest way to make money?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** Reinvesting your earnings into upgrades as quickly as possible. The faster you upgrade, the faster your income grows. This exponential growth is the core of the game.

*   **[FR]** **Q: What should I upgrade first?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** In the very beginning, focus on opening a few tables and upgrading your chef once or twice to get a steady flow of customers. After that, try to keep all parts of your restaurant (kitchen, delivery, tables) upgrading at a balanced pace.

*   **[FR]** **Q: Why should I buy a new restaurant?**
    *   **[FR]** **A:** Each new restaurant provides a massive boost to your overall income and often comes with a permanent multiplier that boosts all your other restaurants as well. It's the main way to progress in the game.
