### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Hoop Stars is a rapid ring‑flip contest. You rotate a ring around a central peg and flip it to land past obstacles. Clean flips that settle over the peg score; misses costs time. Duels reward consistent timing and smart angle setups more than raw speed.
