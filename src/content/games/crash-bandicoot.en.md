<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Crash Bandicoot is a browser‑playable Flash/platformer tribute to the classic series. Make your way through a short set of themed stages, break crates, collect crystals and fruit, and avoid TNT hazards. After obtaining five crystals, you face Ripper Roo in a boss fight; spinning iron crates at him ends the game upon victory.

### How to Play
- Progress through linear stages while gathering crystals and fruit.  
- Break crates for items; avoid TNT and explosive crates.  
- Use the spin attack to destroy certain obstacles and defeat light enemies.  
- Reach the end of the level without falling into pits or traps.

- Spin into crates from a safe distance; never linger near TNT after activation.  
- Grab as many Wumpa fruit as possible for extra lives in some versions.  
- Boss levels emphasize pattern recognition—wait for openings, then spin.
