### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Parking Jam is a Rush‑Hour style puzzle: slide cars along their lanes to clear the path for the target vehicle. Higher levels cram lots with multi‑length cars, one‑way arrows, and blockers requiring precise order of operations.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
