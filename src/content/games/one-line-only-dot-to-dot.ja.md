### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] One line only: dot to dot follows the Euler path tradition: connect all points/edges with a single, unbroken stroke. Boards introduce bridges, forced turns, and parity tricks that require careful route planning and backtracking discipline.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Degree count: Start at odd‑degree nodes (0 or 2 exist for Euler trails); they suggest endpoints.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Bridge first: Draw mandatory bridges early so you don’t lock them out later.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Avoid isolating: Don’t complete loops that strand unvisited edges.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Look‑ahead: Test two moves mentally; backtrack early when isolation appears.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Symmetry: Use symmetrical halves to mirror partial routes.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to draw along segments; undo/clear via UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I end one step short — why?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: You likely started at a wrong endpoint; try an odd‑degree node instead.

- Q: Are crossings allowed?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Only along provided segments; no freehand crossings.

- Q: Any hint system?
