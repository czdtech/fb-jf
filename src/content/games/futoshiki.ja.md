### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Futoshiki ("not equal") is a Latin‑square logic puzzle like Sudoku but with inequality signs (>, <) between neighboring cells. You must place digits so each row/column contains all numbers exactly once and every inequality is satisfied. The signs create strong chains that power elegant deductions.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  Inequality chains: A>B>C means A≥C+2; pencil candidates accordingly.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  Extremes: A>…>B bounds A high and B low; use 1/Max eliminations on chain ends.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  Row/column scans: Apply Latin constraints to prune candidates aggressively.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  Contradiction loops: Assume a value on tight cells; backtrack if an inequality breaks or row/col duplicates.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  Symmetry: Balanced puzzles often have mirrored inequality structures — exploit them.

### Controls Guide

- Tap a cell to enter candidates/values; toggle pencil mode; undo/redo.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I can’t progress — any tip?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Expand inequality chains into explicit bounds (e.g., if 5>□>3 then middle ∈ {4}); combine with row/col hits.

- Q: Are guesses required?
  
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Good sets are solvable logically; at worst use controlled assumptions with quick backtrack.

- Q: Difference vs Sudoku?
