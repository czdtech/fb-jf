### Overview
Relaxed collect‑’em‑up on the water: rescue ducklings scattered around a pond and escort them safely back to your nest while avoiding boats and hazards.

### How to Play
- Swim near ducklings to have them follow; return to the nest to bank them.
- Larger trains are riskier—boats can scatter your line; take safe routes.
- Upgrade your nest between trips when offered.

### Controls
- Mouse/Touch or Arrows to steer.

### Tips
- Don’t over‑extend; bank small batches when traffic is heavy.
- Cut diagonals behind slow boats; never cross a bow head‑on.
- Keep your chain compact to avoid stragglers getting clipped.

### FAQ
- Q: Is there a time limit?  
  A: Typically no—play at your pace.
- Q: What ends a run?  
  A: Losing followers to collisions reduces haul; the nest is safe.
- Q: Are there power‑ups?  
  A: Some hosts add boosts or cosmetics; core loop is rescuing and banking.
