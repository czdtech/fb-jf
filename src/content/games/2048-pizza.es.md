### Detailed Game Introduction

2048 Pizza keeps the classic slide‑and‑merge formula but with tasty visuals. Slide tiles in four directions so identical values collide and combine, planning chains while keeping the board from filling.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[ES]** Keep a corner anchor for the highest tile.
2.  **[ES]** Move in two directions primarily to avoid breaking order.
3.  **[ES]** Feed toward the anchor side to set up merges.
4.  **[ES]** Don’t chase random merges that break structure.
5.  **[ES]** When stuck, clear space instead of forcing high merges.

### Controls Guide

- Slide: Arrow keys/Swipes.
- Undo (if available) to rescue missteps.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Board clogs fast—why? You’re moving in all directions; stick to a two‑direction plan.
- Win condition? Reach the target tile (e.g., 2048) or chase high scores.
- Random spawns? Typically 2s and 4s with weighted chances.
