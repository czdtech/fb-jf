### Detailed Game Introduction

Carrom Challenges simulates the tabletop striker‑and‑carrommen game. Use the striker to pocket your pieces (and possibly the queen under cover) while controlling angles and rebound speed. Fouls, cover rules, and limited strokes add tactical depth.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Opening break: Spread pieces while keeping center control; avoid scratching.
2.  Pocket order: Secure easy covers for the queen; don’t leave it exposed.
3.  Speed control: Gentle hits improve precision and reduce rebounds.
4.  Bank lines: Learn common angles off the boards for tough pockets.
5.  Safety: When no high‑percentage shot exists, leave opponents snookered.
