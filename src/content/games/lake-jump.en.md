## English Guide

### Detailed Game Introduction

Lake Jump is a minimalist tap‑to‑jump challenge. Time taps to land on moving or spaced platforms, maintain rhythm, and rack up streaks without falling in the water.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Count beats: Use a steady rhythm for predictable jump timing.
2.  Aim for centers: Landing in the middle of platforms gives more correction time.
3.  Watch platform speed: Faster cycles require earlier taps; adjust quickly.
4.  Skip greed: Ignore risky coins when alignment is poor.
5.  Reset calmly: After a miss, re‑establish rhythm before chasing streaks.

### Controls Guide

- Jump: Tap/Click at the right moment.
- Pause/Retry: On‑screen buttons.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- I overshoot—why? You’re tapping too early; delay slightly and practice a steady cadence.
- Are there power‑ups? Some modes include slow‑mo or bigger platforms temporarily.
- Endless? Typically yes; set personal bests.
