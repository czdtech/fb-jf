### Detailed Game Introduction

Stars Aligned is a gentle spatial puzzle about connecting star fragments into constellations. Rotate pieces to align lines and nodes; later stages introduce more fragments and subtle rotations that demand careful inspection.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Start with anchors: Lock obvious matches first to reduce possibilities.
2.  Check all rotations: Slight orientation changes often reveal hidden fits.
3.  Symmetry cues: Many constellations are symmetric—use mirroring to test placements.
4.  Isolate sub‑graphs: Solve small connected groups before linking the whole.
5.  Zoom for precision: Use any zoom to verify nearly‑aligned joints.

### Controls Guide

- Rotate pieces and drag them into place per the UI.
- Undo/Reset as needed to test patterns.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- A line won’t connect—bug? Usually a tiny rotation difference; nudge or rotate one step more.
- Timers? Often relaxed; enjoy the ambient pace.
- Hints? Some modes include hints; use sparingly.
