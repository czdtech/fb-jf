### **Game Introduction**

Happy Wheels is a physics-based, side-scrolling platformer game known for its graphic violence and dark humor. The gameplay does not focus on simply winning, but on survival. Players control a variety of unconventional characters, each with a unique and often comically unsafe vehicle, such as a dad on a bicycle with his son, a man in a jet-powered wheelchair, or a person on a Segway.

The primary objective in most levels is to navigate a treacherous obstacle course and reach a finish line. The challenge lies in the game's brutal and realistic physics engine. Characters can be dismembered, crushed, and impaled in countless gruesome ways, yet can often continue towards the goal as long as their core body is intact.

A defining feature of Happy Wheels is its extensive user-generated content. The game includes a powerful level editor, allowing players to create and share their own complex, creative, and often sadistic courses. This results in a virtually endless supply of levels, ranging from simple races to elaborate puzzle-solving adventures and impossible-to-survive death traps.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

1.  **Control Your Speed**: Speed is not always your friend. Going too fast often leads to losing control and crashing into an obstacle. Learn to gently accelerate and decelerate to navigate tight spaces and unpredictable terrain.
2.  **Master Your Character**: Each character controls differently and has unique special abilities.
    *   **Wheelchair Guy**: His jet booster provides a powerful burst of speed, useful for clearing large gaps, but it's hard to control. Use it in short bursts.
    *   **Segway Guy**: Can jump, making him more agile for platforming challenges. His upright stance, however, makes him very unstable.
    *   **Irresponsible Dad**: Can brake hard. His son adds extra weight and can be detached, sometimes serving as a morbid counterweight or shield.
3.  **Lean for Balance**: Leaning your character forward and backward (using the up and down arrow keys) is crucial for maintaining balance. Lean back when going up steep hills to prevent flipping over, and lean forward when going down to maintain speed and control.
4.  **Survival Over Perfection**: You don't need to finish a level in pristine condition. You can win a level even if your character has lost both legs and an arm. The goal is to get the character's torso to the finish line. Sometimes, sacrificing a limb to an obstacle is a viable strategy.
5.  **Learn to Eject**: The 'Z' key allows most characters to eject from their vehicle. This is a last-ditch move that can be used to fling your character's body across a gap to the finish line when the vehicle is destroyed or stuck.
6.  **Explore Different Level Types**: Don't just play the featured levels. Use the level browser to find different kinds of challenges. Search for terms like "puzzle," "rope swing," or "BMX" to find unique and creative maps made by the community.

### **Controls Guide**

The controls are relatively standard but have specific functions for each character.

**Primary Controls:**
*   **Accelerate**: `Up Arrow` key
*   **Decelerate / Reverse**: `Down Arrow` key
*   **Lean Left / Backward**: `Left Arrow` key
*   **Lean Right / Forward**: `Right Arrow` key

**Action Keys:**
*   **Primary Special Ability**: `Space Bar` (e.g., Wheelchair Guy's jet, Segway Guy's jump)
*   **Secondary Special Abilities**: `Shift` and `Ctrl` keys (used for actions like moving legs or rotating arms after ejecting)
*   **Eject**: `Z` key (abandons the vehicle)

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**1. Why is this game so graphic and violent?**
The over-the-top, graphic violence is a core part of the game's identity and its black humor. It's a defining feature of its physics-based ragdoll system, designed to be shocking and absurdly funny.

**2. Can I still win if my character is badly injured?**
Yes. The win condition for most levels is for the main character's torso to cross the finish line. You can win even after losing all limbs.

**3. How do I find good or fun levels to play?**
Use the in-game level browser. You can play the "Featured Levels," which are curated by the community, or browse the most played levels. You can also use the search function to look for specific types of levels or creators.

**4. Some characters or levels are not available. How do I unlock them?**
In the free web version of the game, many characters and the level editor are often locked or limited. The full version of the game typically provides access to all characters and features.

**5. The game is running very slowly or lagging. What can I do?**
Happy Wheels can be demanding on your computer, especially on very large or complex user-created levels with many objects. Try closing other browser tabs and applications to free up resources. Playing on a more powerful computer or using a different web browser can also help.
