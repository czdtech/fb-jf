### Detailed Game Introduction

Crazy Balls challenges you to send balls through obstacle‑filled stages, leveraging ricochets, bumpers, and moving elements. Precision angles and controlled power separate clean clears from chaotic misses.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Use side walls to bend trajectories into tight corridors.
2.  Favor medium power for consistency; max power increases chaos.
3.  Wait a beat for moving obstacles to create openings.
4.  Learn rebound distances to plan multi‑bank routes.
5.  Reset quickly after bad lines to preserve time.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to aim and set power; release to shoot.
- Restart via UI when needed.
