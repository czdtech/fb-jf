### Game Introduction

Bloons TD 3 is a pivotal entry in the tower defense series that significantly expanded upon its predecessors. The core gameplay remains focused on placing monkey towers to pop waves of "Bloons" before they complete a designated path. This installment, however, introduced several key features that became staples of the series.

The game offers multiple tracks and three difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), each with a different number of starting lives and tower costs. Players earn money by popping Bloons, which is then used to buy and upgrade eight different towers. A major change in BTD3 is that each tower has its own unique upgrades, and players can purchase all available upgrades for a single tower, unlike later games which introduced branching paths.

**Key Features of Bloons TD 3:**
-   **New Towers:** The roster was expanded to eight towers, introducing the **Boomerang Thrower**, **Spike-o-pult**, and the crucial support tower, the **Monkey Beacon**.
-   **The MOAB:** This game marks the very first appearance of the **M.O.A.B.** (Massive Ornary Air Blimp). This tough, slow-moving blimp acts as a "boss" on the final round of Easy and Medium difficulties, requiring a powerful, focused defense to take down.
-   **Multiple Tracks & Difficulties:** Provided much more replayability than previous titles.
-   **Full Upgrade System:** Players could fully upgrade a tower by purchasing all of its available enhancements, making for very powerful late-game units.
-   **Persistent Bloon Immunities:** The concepts of **Lead** (immune to sharp), **Black** (immune to explosions), and **White** (immune to freeze) Bloons are central to the game's strategy.

### Gameplay Strategy

-   **Balanced Start:** Begin with Dart Monkeys and Tack Shooters. Upgrade your Dart Monkeys to "Piercing Darts" quickly. A Boomerang Thrower is excellent for covering curved sections of the track.
-   **Prepare for Lead Bloons (Round 26):** Lead Bloons make their first appearance on round 26. You **must** have a Bomb Tower with the "Bigger Bombs" upgrade ready to deal with them. No other early-game tower can pop them.
-   **Leverage the Monkey Beacon:** The Monkey Beacon is one of the most important towers. It increases the range of all towers within its radius. Place it in a central location and build a cluster of your most powerful towers around it. The "Super Range" upgrade for the Beacon is a top priority.
-   **The "Beacon Super Monkey" Strategy:** The most dominant late-game strategy involves placing a Super Monkey right next to a fully upgraded Monkey Beacon. The massive range boost turns the Super Monkey into a full-screen map clearer, essential for handling the dense final waves.
-   **How to Beat the MOAB:** The MOAB appears on round 50 (Easy/Medium). It has a lot of health. The best way to destroy it is with high, single-target damage.
    -   A Super Monkey (especially one buffed by a Beacon) is the best option.
    -   A cluster of several Bomb Towers set to "target strong" can also focus fire on it effectively.
    -   Remember, after the MOAB pops, it releases several Ceramic Bloons, so make sure your defense can handle the aftermath.
-   **Spike-o-pults for Straights:** Place Spike-o-pults at the beginning of long, straight paths. Their spiked balls can travel a long distance, popping multiple Bloons along the way.

### Controls Guide

The game uses a simple and intuitive point-and-`click` interface.

-   **Select & Place Tower:** `Click` a tower from the right-hand panel, then `click` on a valid spot on the map to place it.
-   **Upgrade Tower:** `Click` on an existing tower on the map to see its available upgrades in the panel. `Click` an upgrade to purchase it.
-   **Start Round/Fast Forward:** Use the buttons at the bottom right to start the next round or to speed up the game.
-   **Hotkeys:** Use the number keys (1-8) to select towers. The `spacebar` starts the next round.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:bloons-td-3:i-cant-pop-the-grey-99d90772 -->
**1. I can't pop the grey (Lead) Bloons! What do I do?**
> Lead Bloons are immune to all sharp projectiles (darts, tacks, boomerangs). You must use a Bomb Tower to pop them.

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:bloons-td-3:what-is-the-big-blue-a2bae815 -->
**2. What is the big blue blimp at the end of the game?**
> That is the M.O.A.B. (Massive Ornary Air Blimp). It is a very durable boss Bloon. It moves slowly but can absorb a lot of damage before it pops.

<!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:bloons-td-3:why-should-i-use-the-23ed004c -->
**3. Why should I use the Monkey Beacon? It doesn't attack.**
> The Monkey Beacon is a support tower. It provides a crucial range boost to all towers placed near it. A Super Monkey next to a Beacon can cover almost the entire map, making it far more effective.
