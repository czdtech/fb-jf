### Detailed Game Introduction

Tiles of Egypt is a strategic, triple-tile matching puzzle game with a captivating ancient Egyptian theme. The game challenges you to clear a board stacked with intricately designed tiles. To do this, you must select three identical tiles and place them in a collection tray at the bottom. Once three matching tiles are in the tray, they disappear. The goal is to clear the entire board, but you must plan carefully, as the collection tray has limited space.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** **The Rule of Three:** The entire game is about matching tiles in sets of three. You must select three identical tiles to remove them.
2.  **[FR]** **Limited Tray Space:** Your collection tray at the bottom can only hold a certain number of tiles (usually seven). If you fill it up without making a match, you lose the game. This is the central challenge.
3.  **[FR]** **Think Ahead:** Don't just click on the first available match. Look at the tiles underneath and try to prioritize matches that will uncover the most new tiles. This will give you more options and prevent you from getting stuck.
4.  **[FR]** **Use the Tray as a Buffer:** You can place tiles in the tray that don't immediately form a match. Use this to your advantage to temporarily store a tile while you dig for the other two you need. But be careful not to fill the tray with too many different types of tiles.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple clicks or taps.

*   **[FR]** **Select a Tile:** Click on any uncovered tile on the board to move it to the collection tray below.
