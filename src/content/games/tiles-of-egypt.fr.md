### Commandes

- **Use the Tray as a Buffer:** You can place tiles in the tray that don't immediately form a match. Use this to your advantage to temporarily store a tile while you dig for the other two you need. But be careful not to fill the tray with too many different types of tiles.

- **Think Ahead:** Don't just click on the first available match. Look at the tiles underneath and try to prioritize matches that will uncover the most new tiles. This will give you more options and prevent you from getting stuck.

- **The Rule of Three:** The entire game is about matching tiles in sets of three. You must select three identical tiles to remove them.
