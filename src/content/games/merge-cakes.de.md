### Detailed Game Introduction

Merge Cakes is a sweet and relaxing puzzle game where you combine identical cakes to create new and more magnificent desserts. You start with basic cupcakes and merge your way up to elaborate, multi-layered creations. The goal is to fulfill customer orders, earn coins, and discover every delicious cake in your recipe book. It's a simple, satisfying, and endlessly charming game.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** **The Merge Chain:** The core of the game is merging. Drag one cake and drop it onto an identical cake to create a new, higher-level cake. Two basic cupcakes might make a larger cupcake, which in turn can be merged to create a slice of cake, and so on.
2.  **[DE]** **Fulfill Orders:** At the top of the screen, you will see orders from customers. You must create the specific cakes they are asking for. Fulfilling an order is the primary way to earn coins.
3.  **[DE]** **Manage Your Board:** You only have a limited number of plates on your board. If it fills up, you won't be able to receive new cakes. Always try to make merges to keep space free.
4.  **[DE]** **Use Your Coins:** Spend the coins you earn to buy more cakes from the shop. This is much faster than waiting for the free delivery box and is essential for creating high-level cakes to fill difficult orders.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with simple drag-and-drop controls.

*   **[DE]** **Merge Cakes:** Click and drag one cake and drop it onto another identical cake to merge them.
*   **[DE]** **Buy Cakes:** Click on the shop icon and then click the cake you wish to purchase.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[DE]** **Q: How do I get new cakes?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** A free delivery box will periodically drop a basic cake onto an empty plate. You can also use your coins to buy any type of cake you have previously discovered.

*   **[DE]** **Q: What is the main goal?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** To earn coins by fulfilling customer orders and to discover all the different cake recipes in the game.

*   **[DE]** **Q: My board is full and I can't make any moves. What do I do?**
    *   **[DE]** **A:** You need to create space. Look carefully for any possible merges you might have missed. If there are none, you may have to use the trash can icon to sell a low-level cake to free up a plate.
