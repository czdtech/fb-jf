### Detailed Game Introduction

Captain Gold follows the timeless gold‑miner formula: swing a hook across the screen and release at the right moment to snag gold nuggets and treasures. Heavy objects pull slowly, light ones reel in faster. Stages set cash targets and time limits, with shop upgrades between rounds.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Prioritize big nuggets and bags early for faster quota.
2.  Avoid rocks — they’re heavy and low value unless you must clear space.
3.  Use dynamite (if available) to drop unwanted items mid‑reel.
4.  Shop smart: buy power‑reel or extra dynamite first; evaluate per stage layout.
5.  Timing cues: Release slightly before the hook lines up due to swing momentum.
