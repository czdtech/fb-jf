### Overview
Cut the Rope is a physics‑based puzzle game where you slice ropes to deliver a candy to Om Nom while collecting up to three stars per level. Later stages introduce mechanics like bubbles, air cushions, and hazards that change the candy’s trajectory and timing. 

### How to Play
- Swipe/click to cut ropes in the right order so the candy swings toward Om Nom.  
- Collect stars on the way; time cuts to avoid spikes and other traps.  
- Use interactive elements (e.g., bubbles that float the candy, air puffs that steer) when available. 

### Controls
- Mouse/touch swipes to cut; buttons for level restart/next; some hosts add hint systems. 

### Tips and Strategies
- Visualize the candy’s swing arc before cutting; chain two quick cuts to redirect motion.  
- Pop bubbles near target height so Om Nom can grab the candy.  
- Grab at least two stars first; optimize for three once you understand the timing.  

### FAQ
- Q: Do I need all stars to progress?  
  A: You typically need a certain number of stars to unlock new level packs, not every single one.   
- Q: Are there power‑ups?  
  A: Some versions include optional helpers/hints; availability varies by host.
