- Are there power‑ups? Some versions grant multi‑knives or slows—use them on dense waves.

- Does rotation change? Often yes; be ready for speed spikes and direction flips.

- Why do I keep hitting knives? You’re desyncing—re‑establish rhythm and throw only when clear gaps return.

### Foire aux questions (FAQ)


Ultimate Knife Smash is a timing‑based arcade game. Throw knives into a spinning target without striking existing blades. The rotation speed and direction often change, demanding clean timing, rhythm, and risk control for combo stages.
- Pause/Retry: Use UI controls to restart.

- Throw: Click/tap to launch a knife when the gap aligns.

### Commandes

- Boss targets: Later stages may require extra hits—pace your throws.

- Don’t rush: Missing a cycle is better than forcing a risky throw.

- Aim gaps: Target wide openings first; save tight gaps for slow rotations.

- Count beats: Use a consistent cadence; throw on the same slice of the rotation.

- Watch rotations: Note speed shifts and direction flips before committing throws.
