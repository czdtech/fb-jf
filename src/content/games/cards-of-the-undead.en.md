### Detailed Game Introduction

Cards of the Undead is a turn-based roguelike puzzle game set in a zombie apocalypse. The world is represented by a grid of face-down cards, and you control a hero who can move one space at a time. Each move uncovers a new card, which could be a zombie to fight, valuable coins, or helpful items like health potions and armor. The goal is to strategically navigate the board, manage your health, defeat all the zombies, and survive for as long as possible.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Check Before You Move:** Before moving to a zombie card, always compare your hero's stats (Health and Armor) with the zombie's. Make sure you can survive the encounter. It's often better to find a potion or armor first before taking on a strong enemy.
2.  **Plan Your Path:** Don't just move randomly. Try to plan a path that allows you to pick up helpful items before you are forced to fight a powerful zombie. Clearing a path to a health potion can be a lifesaver.
3.  **Know Your Hero:** Different heroes have different skills. Use your hero's unique abilities to your advantage. Some might be better at fighting, while others might be better at finding treasure.
4.  **Level Up:** Defeating zombies grants you Experience Points (XP). Leveling up will restore your health and improve your stats, making you stronger for the challenges ahead.
