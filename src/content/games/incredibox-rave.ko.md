### **Incredibox Rave Game Introduction**

*Incredibox Rave* is a visually striking fan-made mod for the music creation game Incredibox. This version transports players directly into the energetic atmosphere of a **rave or nightclub**, complete with large speakers, a disco ball, and dynamic spotlights. The characters are stylized as silhouetted or neon-outlined figures, resembling DJs and club-goers.

The game uses the classic Incredibox drag-and-drop gameplay. Players are given a palette of 20 sound icons, which are represented by abstract geometric shapes and stylized lips. By assigning these icons to the seven performers, players can compose their own high-energy tracks inspired by various genres of **electronic dance music (EDM), such as techno, house, and disco**.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

Strategy in *Incredibox Rave* is about layering the different electronic elements to build a track that could be played in a real club.

1.  **[KO]** **Understand the Electronic Sound Palette**: The abstract icons can be grouped into the four standard categories based on their function.
    *   **[KO]** **Beats (Squares)**: The icons shaped like squares are your rhythmic foundation. Expect to find driving **drum machine patterns**, electronic kicks, snares, and hi-hats.
    *   **[KO]** **Effects (Circles)**: The circular icons provide the atmospheric and bass elements. This includes deep **synth basslines**, ambient pads, and other textures that fill out the soundscape.
    *   **[KO]** **Melodies (Triangles)**: The triangular icons are your main hooks and riffs. These represent **lead synth melodies**, catchy arpeggios, and other melodic patterns that define the track's tune.
    *   **[KO]** **Voices (Lips)**: The icons shaped like lips are the vocal elements. Look for **processed vocal samples**, ad-libs, and melodic vocal chops that are common in electronic music.

2.  **[KO]** **Four-on-the-Floor Foundation**: A great way to start a club track is to find a solid "four-on-the-floor" kick drum pattern from the "Beats" (squares) category. This provides the classic, danceable pulse.

3.  **[KO]** **Build the Groove**: Once the beat is established, add a bassline from the "Effects" (circles) category. A good synergy between the kick drum and the bass is key to making the track feel powerful and groovy.

4.  **[KO]** **Layer for Energy**: Build energy by adding melodic elements. Start with a simple synth pad ("Effects") to create space, then add a catchy lead melody ("Melodies"). Finally, drop in a vocal chop ("Voices") to complete the mix.

5.  **[KO]** **Systematic Bonus Hunting**: To find the secret bonuses, be methodical. Establish a solid beat and bassline, then systematically swap out the melody and voice icons one by one until you trigger one of the rave-themed animations.

### **Controls Guide**

The controls follow the standard, intuitive drag-and-drop interface of the official Incredibox games.

*   **[KO]** **Add a Sound**: **Drag** a sound icon from the bottom and **drop** it onto one of the characters.
*   **[KO]** **Remove a Sound**: Click the "X" on an active sound icon at the bottom, or drag a new sound onto an existing character to replace it.
*   **[KO]** **Mute / Unmute**: **Click** on a performing character to mute them; click again to unmute.
*   **[KO]** **Solo**: Click the **small button** next to an active character to mute all other performers.
*   **[KO]** **Record**: Click the **record button** to start and stop recording your rave anthem.
