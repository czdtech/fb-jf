### Detailed Game Introduction

Jump With Justin 2 is a light platformer centered on springy jumps, moving platforms, and trap timing. Plan arcs, chain bounces, and keep momentum to reach exits with minimal mistakes.

4.  Drill tough rooms: Restart segments to map exact jump windows.
5.  Optional stars: Grab collectibles only on safe arcs.

- Restart: Fast restart to practice sequences.
