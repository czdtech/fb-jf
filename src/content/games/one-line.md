### Game Introduction

"One Line" is a minimalist puzzle game. Players' task is to draw a single continuous line to connect all given points on the board without lifting their finger or retracing any path. The game aims to train players' logical thinking and spatial perception, with difficulty gradually increasing as levels progress.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Observe Paths**: Before starting to draw, carefully observe all points and their potential connections to plan the optimal path.
2.  **Find Starting Point**: Try starting from different points; sometimes a specific starting point can make solving the puzzle easier.
3.  **Avoid Dead Ends**: In some cases, if a point has only one exit, it often means that path must be taken.
4.  **Utilize Symmetry**: If the board has a symmetrical structure, try to use this symmetry to aid in solving.
5.  **Practice More**: Practice makes perfect; through extensive practice, you will gradually grasp the tricks and patterns for solving.

### How to Play

*   **Start Drawing**: Click any point as the starting point, then drag the mouse or finger (on touch devices) to connect to the next point.
*   **Connect Points**: Ensure each move connects to a new, unvisited point.
*   **Reset Level**: If you make a mistake or get stuck, you can click the reset button to restart the current level.
