### Detailed Game Introduction

Carrom Challenges simulates the tabletop striker‑and‑carrommen game. Use the striker to pocket your pieces (and possibly the queen under cover) while controlling angles and rebound speed. Fouls, cover rules, and limited strokes add tactical depth.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[FR]** Opening break: Spread pieces while keeping center control; avoid scratching.
2.  **[FR]** Pocket order: Secure easy covers for the queen; don’t leave it exposed.
3.  **[FR]** Speed control: Gentle hits improve precision and reduce rebounds.
4.  **[FR]** Bank lines: Learn common angles off the boards for tough pockets.
5.  **[FR]** Safety: When no high‑percentage shot exists, leave opponents snookered.

### Controls Guide

- Aim by dragging the cursor arc; set power with the slider; release to strike.
- Rules panel explains fouls/queen cover for the current mode.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: What is “covering the queen”?

A: After pocketing the queen, you must pocket one of your own pieces in the next stroke; failing to do so returns the queen to the board.

- Q: How to avoid scratches?

A: Control rebound angles and reduce power on thin contacts.

- Q: Are board speeds adjustable?

A: Some versions provide friction settings; otherwise adapt with lighter strokes.
