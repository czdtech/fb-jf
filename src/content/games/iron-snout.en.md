<!-- i18n:section:introduction -->
### Overview
Iron Snout is a fast 2D brawler starring a martial‑arts pig fighting wolves. With simple directional inputs you punch, kick, duck, and jump to parry attacks, catch thrown axes, and reflect rockets. Survival hinges on reading telegraphed moves and maintaining a steady rhythm of counters.
