[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] You start as a relatively small shark, only able to eat the smallest of fish. As you consume prey, you gain points and gradually increase in size. This growth is key, as it allows you to hunt and eat progressively larger creatures, from medium-sized fish to other sharks and even unsuspecting swimmers. However, the ocean is a dangerous place. You must constantly be on the lookout for threats, such as sharks larger than you, deadly sea mines, and other hazards that can end your run instantly. The game is an endless arcade experience focused on achieving the highest possible score.

### Gameplay Strategy
**1. How do I grow bigger in the game?**（日本語訳が必要）

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Success in *Big Shark* depends on a mix of aggression and caution.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Be Cautious at the Start:** When you are small, you are extremely vulnerable. Focus exclusively on eating the smallest fish and actively avoid everything else. Don't get greedy; survival is your top priority in the early stages.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Know Your Prey:** You can only eat creatures that are smaller than you. The game usually provides a clear visual cue. If something is your size or larger, it's either a competitor or a threat.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Use Your Boost Wisely:** Most versions of the game give you a speed boost ability. This is your most important tool for both offense and defense.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **For Offense:** Use the boost to quickly close the distance and catch faster-moving prey.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **For Defense:** The boost is your lifeline for escaping larger sharks that are chasing you. Don't waste it, and try to have it ready for emergencies.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Memorize the Threats:**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Bigger Sharks:** The most common threat. Touching one means an instant game over. Always give them a wide berth.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Sea Mines:** These explosive devices are often stationary. Colliding with one is fatal. Be especially careful when boosting through crowded areas.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED]     *   **Jellyfish:** In some versions, these can sting you, causing you to lose points or get temporarily stunned.
