### Detailed Game Introduction

Snowboard King 2024 is a thrilling, fast-paced arcade game where you snowboard down a treacherous, endless mountain slope. Your primary goal is to survive for as long as possible, skillfully navigating around obstacles like trees and rocks. Adding to the challenge, a deadly avalanche is constantly chasing you from behind, forcing you to maintain your speed and think fast. Collect coins along the way to upgrade your abilities and solidify your title as the Snowboard King.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Look Ahead:** The key to a long run is anticipation. Keep your eyes focused far down the slope to see upcoming obstacles and plan your path well in advance.
2.  **Smooth Movements:** Avoid sharp, sudden turns. Make small, controlled movements to weave between trees and rocks. Over-steering can easily lead to a crash.
3.  **Strategic Boosting:** Your boost gives you a burst of speed, which is essential for outrunning the avalanche. However, it also makes it harder to steer. Use your boost on long, clear stretches, not when you are navigating a dense forest of obstacles.
4.  **Upgrade Your Skills:** Use the coins you collect to upgrade your snowboarder's abilities between runs. Improving your "Carve" (turning speed) and "Boost" will make subsequent runs much easier.

### Controls Guide

*   **Steer:** Use the **A/D keys** or the **Left/Right Arrow keys** to steer your snowboarder.
*   **Boost:** Press the **Spacebar** to activate a temporary speed boost.
