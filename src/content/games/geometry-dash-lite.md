### Overview
Entry version of the rhythm platformer: clear curated levels with jump pads, gravity portals, and ship sections synced to music.

### How to Play
- Tap/jump on the beat to pass spikes and saws.
- Hold to fly the ship smoothly; keep altitude steady.
- Memorize tricky segments and practice mode if available.

### Controls
- Space/Mouse/Touch to jump; hold to fly; practice toggles vary by host.

### Tips
- Turn on practice for tough sections to set checkpoints.
- Use music cues to predict upcoming jumps.
- Keep ship inputs gentle; over‑correction causes crashes.

### FAQ
- Q: How do I beat hard levels without memorizing everything?  
  A: Use practice mode to learn patterns, then switch to normal for a clean run.
- Q: Why does my ship keep crashing?  
  A: You are oversteering; use small holds and release to settle.
- Q: Are custom levels included?  
  A: Lite focuses on built‑in tracks; custom levels depend on host.
