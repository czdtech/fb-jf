### Overview
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Balance a car carrying a fragile egg across hilly terrain. Sudden bumps crack the egg; smooth throttle wins.

### How to Play
- Keep speed low on downhill; accelerate gently uphill to avoid bouncing.
- Grab fuel cans to extend runs; collect coins for vehicle upgrades (host dependent).
- Long runs demand rhythmic throttle taps, not holds.

### Controls
- A/D or Arrows to drive/brake; R: restart.

### Tips
- Treat crests like jumps—lift before the peak, reapply after landing.
- If the egg wobbles, briefly brake to settle it.
- Upgrades that improve suspension help the most early on.

### FAQ
- Q: What ends a run?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Cracks (egg breaks) or running out of fuel.
- Q: Is there a finish line?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: It’s a distance/high‑score chase in most hosts.
- Q: Best early strategy?  
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED]   A: Drive slow; protect the egg—speed comes with smoother lines.
