### Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Breaking the Bank is a short, interactive, choice-based animated game. It is the very first installment in the popular Henry Stickmin series. The game presents a simple scenario: the protagonist, a stick figure named Henry Stickmin, stands before a bank in the middle of a desert, contemplating how to break in and rob it.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Unlike traditional games, there is no direct control over movement or actions. Instead, the gameplay consists of a single decision point. The player is presented with a selection of six different methods or tools to break into the bank. The core appeal of the game lies not in finding the correct answer, but in exploring the hilarious and unique "FAIL" animations that result from each incorrect choice. The goal is to find the one and only correct option that allows Henry to succeed.

### Gameplay Walkthrough
