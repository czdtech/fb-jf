### Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Breaking the Bank is a short, interactive, choice-based animated game. It is the very first installment in the popular Henry Stickmin series. The game presents a simple scenario: the protagonist, a stick figure named Henry Stickmin, stands before a bank in the middle of a desert, contemplating how to break in and rob it.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Unlike traditional games, there is no direct control over movement or actions. Instead, the gameplay consists of a single decision point. The player is presented with a selection of six different methods or tools to break into the bank. The core appeal of the game lies not in finding the correct answer, but in exploring the hilarious and unique "FAIL" animations that result from each incorrect choice. The goal is to find the one and only correct option that allows Henry to succeed.

### Gameplay Walkthrough

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The gameplay in Breaking the Bank is entirely based on trial and error. There is only one choice to make in the entire game.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] You are presented with six options displayed at the bottom of the screen:
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Explosives:** Try to blow a hole in the wall.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Laser Drill:** Use a high-tech laser to cut through the wall.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Shovel:** Dig a tunnel underneath the bank.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Wrecking Ball:** Call in a wrecking ball to smash the wall.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Disguise:** Try to sneak in using a disguise.
6.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **Teleporter:** Use a futuristic device to teleport inside.

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] **The Solution:**
[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] > There is only one correct path to win the game. The correct option to choose is the **Shovel**. This will trigger an animation of Henry successfully digging a tunnel into the bank's vault. Any other choice will result in a humorous FAIL screen. The fun of the game is clicking on all the other options first to see the funny outcomes.

### Controls Guide

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is controlled entirely with the mouse.

-   **Mouse Cursor:** Move the cursor to hover over an option.
-   **Left-Click:** Click on your desired option to see what happens.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
