### Detailed Game Introduction

[ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] SortWorks blends visual sorting with bin constraints (color/shape/type). Items arrive on belts; you must route them to correct bins, using buffer slots to prevent jams. Late boards raise speed and add tricky categories.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough
1.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Rule hierarchy: Apply critical rules first (e.g., hazard vs non‑hazard) then fine categories.
2.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Buffer discipline: Keep at least one buffer slot free at all times.
3.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Batch easy items: Chain streaks on simple categories to maintain multipliers.
4.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Error cost: Skip uncertain items rather than mis‑sort.
5.  [ZH TRANSLATION NEEDED] Eye flow: Scan ahead of the belt; don’t tunnel on the nearest item.

### Controls Guide

- Drag/tap items to bins; pause/retry via UI; hints may highlight targets.
