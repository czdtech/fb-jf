### **Game Introduction**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] *Block Breaker King: Mission* is a strategic block puzzle game, where the gameplay is similar to the placement mechanics of *Tetris* but without the falling blocks. The objective is to **strategically place various Tetris-like shapes onto a grid to create and clear full horizontal or vertical lines.**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] At the bottom of the screen, players are presented with a selection of different block shapes. You must drag and drop these shapes onto the main game board. When a complete horizontal row or a vertical column is filled with blocks, that line will be cleared, freeing up space on the board.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game ends when you are unable to place any of the given shapes onto the board because there is no available space that fits them. The challenge lies in careful planning and efficient placement to keep the board as clear as possible for as long as possible, aiming to achieve the highest score. The "Mission" aspect, as shown in the screenshots, suggests a level-based progression system with specific objectives for each stage.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 1.  **Prioritize Clearing Lines**: Your primary goal should always be to clear lines. When deciding where to place a block, look for the spot that will either complete a line immediately or set up an easy completion with the next one or two pieces.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 2.  **Avoid Creating Single Gaps**: Be very careful not to leave single, isolated empty squares in the middle of your structure. These "holes" are extremely difficult to fill later on and can quickly lead to a game over as they waste valuable space.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 3.  **Think About the Next Pieces**: The game shows you the upcoming pieces. Plan your placements not just for the current piece, but also considering how the next pieces will fit onto the board.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 4.  **Use Corners and Edges**: Try to build your structure from the corners and edges inward. This generally keeps the central area of the board more open and flexible for placing larger or awkwardly shaped pieces.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 5.  **Don't Be Afraid to Sacrifice a Combo**: While clearing multiple lines at once (a combo) gives a high score, it's not always the best move. Sometimes, making a simple, single-line clear is a better strategic choice if it prevents you from creating a problematic gap or blocking off a large area.
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] 6.  **Manage Your Large Pieces**: The large square (3x3) and long line pieces (1x5 or 5x1) require the most space. Try to always keep enough open area on your board to accommodate them. If you can't place a large piece, the game can end very quickly.

### **Controls Guide**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] The game is designed for simple one-touch mobile gameplay.

*   **Select and Place**: **Touch and hold** a block shape from the bottom of the screen, **drag** it to the desired position on the grid, and **release** to place it.
*   **Rotate**: In many games of this type, you can tap the shape before dragging it to rotate it. This may or may not be a feature depending on the specific version.

### **Frequently Asked questions (FAQ)**

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **1. Is there a time limit?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Typically, games in this genre do not have a time limit per move. The pressure comes from the limited space on the board, not from a clock. This makes it a game of pure strategy rather than speed.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **2. Can I rotate the blocks?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] This depends on the specific game mode or version. In the classic mode of this puzzle type, blocks cannot be rotated, which adds to the challenge. Some versions may include a mode where rotation is possible.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **3. What is the goal of the "Mission" mode?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] As shown in the first screenshot, the "Mission" mode is a series of pre-designed levels (Stage 1, 2, 3, etc.). Each level likely has a specific objective, such as "clear 10 lines," "score X points," or surviving a certain number of pieces, which you must complete to unlock the next stage.

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] **4. How do I get a high score?**
[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] High scores are achieved by:
*   **Clearing multiple lines at once**: Combos give significantly more points than single-line clears.
*   **Surviving for a long time**: The more pieces you successfully place, the higher your score will be.
*   **Using special blocks**: Some levels may contain special blocks (like the bomb in one of the screenshots) that clear a larger area when their line is completed.
