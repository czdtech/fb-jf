### Detailed Game Introduction

Kings and Queens wraps a castle‑restoration story around classic match‑3. Each chapter introduces new blockers (chains, marble slabs, fog) and scene goals (collect crowns, break seals). You spend earned stars to renovate rooms, unlocking boosters for harder boards.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Board control: Clear central blockers first to open space for combos.
2.  Booster timing: Save hammers/rockets for late‑board choke points.
3.  Combo planning: Merge power‑ups (bomb+line/color clears) right before tight goals.
4.  Star economy: Spend on boosters that directly help your current hurdle.
5.  Move math: Count remaining blockers vs moves and play for the objective, not points.

### Controls Guide

- Drag to swap; tap boosters to use; scene menu to renovate with stars.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I’m stuck on a marble slab level — any tip?
  
  A: Use bombs near slabs and chain line clears through them to crack multiple layers.

- Q: Should I hoard boosters?
  
  A: Keep a few, but spend to break brick‑wall stages; progression matters.

- Q: Renovations affect gameplay?
  
  A: Mostly cosmetic; some unlock booster slots or daily rewards.
