### **Game Introduction**

Cluster Rush is a fast-paced, first-person 3D platformer with a simple yet incredibly challenging premise: you must jump from truck to truck in a chaotic, moving convoy to reach the finish line. The ground is effectively non-existent, and any fall results in an instant restart of the level.

The gameplay is entirely physics-based, demanding precise timing, momentum control, and quick reflexes. Players must navigate swerving, crashing, and sometimes exploding trucks that serve as their only platforms. The game is structured into a series of levels, grouped into different worlds, with each level introducing new obstacles and more complex truck patterns. It is a game of pure skill, trial-and-error, and mastering movement to overcome seemingly impossible challenges.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

Success in Cluster Rush is about mastering movement and learning the levels.

1.  **Look Ahead, Not Down**: This is the most critical rule. Your focus should always be two or three trucks ahead of your current position. Planning your next jumps in advance is essential for maintaining flow and not getting trapped.
2.  **Momentum is Everything**: Your jump distance is directly tied to your running speed. Use the sprint button to make long jumps, but also learn when to let go of it for shorter, more controlled hops. You do not need to be sprinting 100% of the time.
3.  **Master the Double Jump**: The double jump is your most versatile tool. It can be used to gain extra height, extend your airtime to wait for a truck to get into position, or to correct your trajectory mid-air after a bad initial jump.
4.  **Use the Sides of Trucks**: You can cling to and slide along the sides of trucks. This is a crucial life-saving technique. If you are about to miss a landing, aim for the side of the truck. This allows you to recover, readjust, and jump again.
5.  **Learn the Level Patterns**: The truck movements in each level are not random; they follow a set pattern. The game is about trial and error. Pay attention to how the trucks move on each attempt. Memorizing the route is key to completing difficult levels.
6.  **Think Vertically**: Don't just jump between trucks at the same height. Look for opportunities to jump from a low truck onto the roof of a much taller one to find a safer or faster path.
7.  **Embrace Failure**: You will fail hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Each failure is a learning opportunity. Don't get frustrated; instead, analyze why you failed (e.g., jumped too early, not enough speed) and adjust on your next attempt.

### **Controls Guide**

The controls are similar to most first-person PC games.

*   **Move**: `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys
*   **Look**: Mouse
*   **Jump**: `Space Bar`
*   **Double Jump**: Press `Space Bar` again while in the air
*   **Sprint**: `Shift` key (hold down to run faster)
*   **Pause/Menu**: `Esc` key

**Note:** Grabbing or sliding along the side of a truck is a contextual action. You do not need to press a specific key; simply make contact with the side of a truck while in the air.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**1. Are the truck movements random in each level?**
No, the patterns are pre-determined for each level. While it may look chaotic, the trucks' paths are the same every time you play a specific level, making it possible to learn and master the routes.

**2. I keep falling short on my jumps. What am I doing wrong?**
This is almost always a momentum issue. Make sure you are holding down the `Shift` key to sprint before you make a long jump. For very long jumps, ensure you have a decent "runway" on the truck before you leap.

**3. Is there a way to save my progress in the middle of a level?**
No, there are no checkpoints. Each level must be completed from start to finish in a single run. This is a core part of the game's design and challenge.

**4. How do I unlock new worlds or levels?**
You unlock new levels and worlds by successfully completing the previous ones in sequential order.

**5. Some levels seem impossible. Any advice?**
Patience is key. If you are truly stuck, take a break to clear your head. You can also try watching a video playthrough of that specific level online to see the intended or an alternative route you may not have considered. Often, there's a specific trick or path that makes it much easier.
