### Detailed Game Introduction

Jurassic Run is a fast endless runner set among dinosaurs and jungle obstacles. Read the track ahead, switch lanes or jump/slide to avoid hazards, and chain coin pickups as speed increases.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Look far ahead to plan early lane changes.
2.  Skip risky coins when gaps are tight; safety keeps runs alive.
3.  Memorize repeating obstacle sets to pre‑position.
4.  Make small, crisp inputs at higher speeds.
5.  Save shields/magnets for dense stretches if available.

### Controls Guide

- Move: A/D or Left/Right; jump/slide with Space/Up and Down.
- Pause/Retry via on‑screen UI.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Keep clipping—why? Jump slightly later and avoid over‑steering.
- Is there an end? Usually endless—chase personal bests.
- Power‑ups? Many versions include shields, magnets, or slow‑mo.
