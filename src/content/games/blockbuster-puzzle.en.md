### Detailed Game Introduction

Blockbuster Puzzle tasks you with fitting incoming shapes to trigger line or cluster clears. The art is in pacing: keep multiple lanes viable, prepare “bomb” turns that clear large areas, and never burn your last escape pocket unless it secures a chain.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Keep two lanes free: Always preserve at least two flexible build lanes for awkward shapes.
2.  Bank a bailout slot: Reserve one pocket to recover from bad piece sets.
3.  Cluster thinking: Group related shapes so one placement sets up several clears.
4.  Avoid single‑cell cavities: These are nearly impossible to fill consistently.
5.  Convert advantage: When the board is open, push for multi‑line clears to snowball space.

### Controls Guide

- `Drag`‑and‑`drop` pieces; rotate if supported.
- Undo/Reset can recover from greedy mistakes.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:blockbuster-puzzle:why-do-i-keep-losing-4221c529 -->
  Q: Why do I keep losing despite early good clears?
  
  A: You’re over‑committing to one side and losing flexibility. Rebalance and keep a bailout pocket.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:blockbuster-puzzle:is-rotation-required-to-win-7544547c -->
  Q: Is rotation required to win?
  
  A: No, but it helps. When rotation is limited, rely on symmetry and larger open lanes.

- <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:blockbuster-puzzle:should-i-place-big-shapes-9ac1a059 -->
  Q: Should I place big shapes first or last?
  
  A: When the grid is tight, place the hardest shape first. When open, place to create multi‑line setups.
