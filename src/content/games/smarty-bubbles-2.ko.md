### Detailed Game Introduction

Smarty Bubbles 2 continues the fun of the classic bubble shooter with a polished look and hundreds of new levels. The objective remains the same: clear the entire board of colorful bubbles by shooting and matching three or more of the same color. This sequel challenges you to think strategically to create massive chain reactions and clear each stage, all while managing your shots to prevent the ceiling from dropping.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Avoid Misses:** Just like the original, the key is to make every shot count. After a certain number of shots that don't pop any bubbles, a new row will be added from the top, making the game harder. An indicator on the side will show you how many misses you have left.
2.  **[KO]** **Aim for Avalanches:** The most efficient way to win is to pop bubble clusters that are supporting other bubbles. This will cause all the unsupported bubbles to fall, clearing the screen much faster.
3.  **[KO]** **Use the Walls:** Master bouncing your shots off the side walls. This is an essential skill for reaching difficult spots and setting up clever matches.
4.  **[KO]** **Plan Ahead:** The game shows you the next bubble in your cannon. Use this information to plan your next move. Sometimes it's best to make a less optimal shot now to set up a perfect shot with the next bubble.

### Controls Guide

*   **[KO]** **Aim:** Move your mouse to aim the cannon. A guideline will show the bubble's trajectory.
*   **[KO]** **Shoot:** Click the left mouse button to fire the bubble.
