### Detailed Game Introduction

Jewel Duel layers RPG elements onto match‑3 combat. Matching certain colors fuels attacks/defense/skills; enemy turns follow yours, so turn order matters. Some foes carry shields/absorbs that require specific match types, adding puzzle depth beyond raw damage.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Match intent: Prioritize color that fuels your needed action (attack vs heal vs shield).
2.  Turn tempo: Deny enemy ult turns by breaking shields or stuns before their phase.
3.  Setup cascades: Clear low‑impact gems now to prepare high‑value cascades next turn.
4.  Targeting: Focus one enemy at a time to remove damage sources.
5.  Boss mechanics: Read tooltips; some require special matches or row clears.

### Controls Guide

- Swap adjacent gems; trigger skills when charged; read enemy intents.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Q: I do low damage — why?
  
  A: You’re matching the wrong colors for your build; fuel attack gems or break shields first.

- Q: Any tip for multi‑target fights?
  
  A: Eliminate high‑threat targets first; use row/column clears for board control.

- Q: Can I save skills?
  
  A: Yes — hold until you can chain with a big cascade or to interrupt enemy ultimates.
