### Overview
Daily Crossword provides a new crossword each day with familiar American‑style rules: fill Across and Down answers so all letters cross‑check. Many hosts include timers, clue lists, and tools to check or reveal entries. 

### How to Play
- Select a clue or cell and type letters to fill the entry; arrow keys move the cursor.  
- Use crossings to confirm uncertain answers; return to long entries later.  
- Daily streaks and leaderboards may be supported depending on the host. 

### Controls
- Type A–Z; arrow keys navigate; Backspace deletes; Enter/Tab switches direction or advances (site‑dependent). 

### Tips and Strategies
- Start with short/easy clues, then expand using crossings.  
- Use Check tools sparingly to avoid time penalties if a host tracks time.
