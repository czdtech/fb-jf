### Game Introduction

"Sudoku" is a classic number puzzle game where players fill a 9x9 grid with digits 1-9, ensuring each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all numbers exactly once. This logic-based brain teaser challenges players' reasoning abilities and patience.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Start Simple**: Look for cells with only one possible answer first; these are usually breakthrough points.
2.  **Elimination Method**: Observe existing numbers in rows, columns, and boxes to eliminate impossible options.
3.  **Candidate Number Method**: Mark possible numbers in empty cells to help with analysis and reasoning.
4.  **Find Hidden Singles**: Look for numbers that can only be placed in one position within a row, column, or box.
5.  **Progressive Advancement**: After filling in each number, re-analyze the entire board to find new breakthrough points.

### How to Play

*   **Select Cell**: Click on empty cells to select them.
*   **Input Numbers**: Use keyboard number keys 1-9 or click on-screen number buttons to input.
*   **Delete Numbers**: Press delete key or click on filled numbers again to clear them.
*   **Mark Candidates**: Some versions allow marking multiple possible candidate numbers in cells.
