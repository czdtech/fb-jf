### Detailed Game Introduction

[JA TRANSLATION NEEDED] Stickman Fighter Mega is a side‑view beat ’em up focused on counter‑timing and spacing. Enemies telegraph swings; punish them with parries, juggles, and area specials. Later waves mix shielded foes, ranged throwers, and heavies that demand varied answers.
