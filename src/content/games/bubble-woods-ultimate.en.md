### Detailed Game Introduction

Bubble Woods Ultimate is a high-energy, fast-paced bubble shooter that challenges you to score as many points as possible within a tight 60-second time limit. Set in a vibrant forest, you must shoot bubbles to create matches of three or more, triggering cascades and earning massive points. The game features a variety of powerful boosters and a level-up system that rewards skillful play, making every round an exciting race against the clock.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Speed is Everything:** With only 60 seconds on the clock, you need to be fast. Aim and shoot quickly. Don't spend too long deliberating on a single shot.
2.  **Build Your Combo for a Fireball:** The key to a huge score is the Fireball. You earn it by making 10 consecutive successful matches (10 "hits"). The Fireball can be shot anywhere and will destroy a large area of bubbles, so use it strategically.
3.  **Aim for Avalanches:** Just like in classic bubble shooters, the biggest points come from detaching large clusters of bubbles. Aim high to pop a small group that is supporting a much larger group below.
4.  **Utilize Power-ups:** Keep an eye out for special bubbles on the board:
    *   **Rainbow Bubble:** Will act as any color it touches, helping you complete a match.
    *   **Bomb Bubble:** Explodes on impact, clearing a small cluster.
    *   **Hourglass:** The most valuable one—hitting it adds a few precious seconds to your timer.

### Controls Guide

*   **Aim:** Move your mouse to aim the bubble cannon.
*   **Shoot:** Click the left mouse button to fire the bubble.
*   **Swap:** You can often click on the cannon or the next bubble in the queue to swap between your current and next projectile.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
