### Detailed Game Introduction

3D Football Mania condenses soccer fundamentals into short scenarios. Read defenders, choose passes, and time shots to beat the keeper in quick, replayable challenges.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[DE]** Use through‑balls: Lead passes into space rather than feet.
2.  **[DE]** Near‑post vs far‑post: Mix finishes; far‑post curls are safer, near‑post power punishes tight angles.
3.  **[DE]** First‑time shots: Strike without extra touches when defenders close rapidly.
4.  **[DE]** Fake and shoot: Small feints open lanes.
5.  **[DE]** Rebounds: Follow shots for tap‑ins.

### Controls Guide

- Move/Pass/Shoot per on‑screen prompts; swipe or buttons.
- Aim shots with drag; set power by hold length.
