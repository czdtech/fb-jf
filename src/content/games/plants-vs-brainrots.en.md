### **Plants vs Brainrots Game Introduction**

*Plants vs Brainrots* is a viral tower defense game developed on the Roblox platform, serving as a modern-day parody of the classic *Plants vs. Zombies*. The game pits players against the overwhelming tide of modern internet "Brain Rot"—a cultural phenomenon of nonsensical, low-effort, and addictive online content. Instead of fending off zombies, your mission is to protect your house (and your sanity) from personified internet memes.

The core gameplay remains faithful to the beloved tower defense formula. You plant a variety of "Brainy" plants in your yard, each with unique abilities, to fight off waves of incoming "Brainrots." These enemies are direct representations of the most pervasive internet memes, from the relentless charge of the **Skibidi Toilets** to the formidable defense of the **Sigmas**.

The game's immense popularity comes from its witty and constantly updated roster of characters, which directly reflects the ever-changing landscape of internet culture, creating a humorous and engaging experience for a new generation of players.

### **Gameplay Strategy & Tips**

1.  **Build Your "Focus" Economy**: Your primary resource is not Sun, but "Focus" (or Sanity Points), generated by **Focus Flowers** (the game's version of Sunflowers). Your first priority in any level is to plant at least two rows of Focus Flowers to ensure you have a steady income to afford other plants.
2.  **Know Your Enemy, Know Your Memes**: Each Brainrot has a specific weakness and behavior.
    *   **Skibidi Toilets**: These are your basic grunts. They are fast but weak. A single line of **Common Sense Shooters** (Peashooters) can handle them.
    *   **Sigmas**: These act as tanks, equivalent to Conehead or Buckethead Zombies. They can absorb a lot of damage. You'll need concentrated firepower or defensive plants like the **Fact-Checker Wall** (Wall-nut) to slow them down.
    *   **The Rizzler/Gyatt**: These are special units. They might have abilities that temporarily disable your plants (by "rizzing" them) or bypass certain defenses. Prioritize eliminating them with high-damage plants.
3.  **The Art of Planting**: A classic layout is key.
    *   **Back Rows**: Reserved for your Focus Flowers.
    *   **Middle Rows**: Your primary damage dealers, like the Common Sense Shooters or explosive **Meme-Eraser Cherries**.
    *   **Front Row**: Place your defensive Fact-Checker Walls here to act as a barrier, especially against tough Sigmas.
4.  **Use Your Ultimate Weapon - The "Touch Grass" Lawn Mower**: Just like the original, each lane is protected by a last-resort lawn mower, thematically redesigned as the "Touch Grass" mower. If a Brainrot gets past all your defenses, this will clear the entire lane once, but don't rely on it.

### **Controls Guide**

As a Roblox game, the controls are simple and `mouse`-driven.

*   **Select Plants**: Use your **`mouse`** to `click` on the plant cards at the top or side of the screen.
*   **Planting**: After selecting a card, `click` on a valid square on your lawn to plant.
*   **Collecting Focus**: `Click` on the Focus icons that your Focus Flowers produce.
*   **Camera Movement**: Use `W, A, S, D` keys or your `mouse` to adjust your view of the lawn.
