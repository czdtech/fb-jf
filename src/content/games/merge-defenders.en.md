### Detailed Game Introduction

Merge Defenders is an exciting and strategic game that blends the addictive nature of merge puzzles with the action-packed gameplay of tower defense. In this game, you must protect your base from relentless waves of enemies. You do this not just by placing towers, but by purchasing basic units, merging two identical units to create a more powerful, higher-level defender, and then strategically deploying them onto the battlefield.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **The Merge Cycle:** The core of the game is the merge mechanic. You start by purchasing level 1 units. Drag a level 1 unit onto another level 1 unit to create a level 2 unit, and so on. Higher-level units have significantly better damage and firing rates.
2.  **Deployment:** You have a limited number of slots on your defensive line. Drag your strongest defenders from your reserve grid onto these slots. They will automatically attack any enemies that come into range.
3.  **Economy Management:** You earn coins for every enemy you defeat. You must constantly decide whether to spend your coins on more low-level units (to merge up) or to save them for special upgrades that might become available.
4.  **Strategic Placement:** Don't just place your strongest unit anywhere. Observe the enemy path. Some slots might be more critical than others, such as at corners where units can cover the path for a longer duration. Place your most powerful defenders in these key positions.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:merge-defenders:q-how-do-i-get-41092844 -->
  **Q: How do I get stronger defenders?**
    *   **A:** By merging. Combine two identical defenders to create one defender of the next level. For example, two Level 2 units merge into one Level 3 unit.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:merge-defenders:q-why-cant-i-place-0b1445b0 -->
  **Q: Why can't I place my defender on the enemy path?**
    *   **A:** You can only place your defensive units in the designated square slots along the path, not on the path itself where the enemies walk.

* <!-- i18n:faq:id=faq:merge-defenders:q-im-being-overwhelmed-by-34515d67 -->
  **Q: I'm being overwhelmed by enemies. What should I do?**
    *   **A:** Focus on merging your units to the highest possible level. A single high-level unit is often much more powerful than several low-level ones. Make sure all your available defensive slots are filled, and continuously buy and merge new units as you earn coins.
