### Detailed Game Introduction

Pirate Poker is a classic five-card draw poker game with a swashbuckling pirate theme. You'll sit at a table with salty pirate opponents, betting your gold doubloons and trying to build the best possible five-card hand. The game involves rounds of betting, a chance to exchange your cards to improve your hand, and a final showdown to see who wins the pot. It's a game of strategy, psychology, and a little bit of luck.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **[KO]** **Know the Hand Rankings:** The goal is to make the best five-card hand. From highest to lowest, the standard rankings are: Royal Flush, Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, and High Card.
2.  **[KO]** **The Draw Phase:** After the first round of betting, you'll have a chance to discard some of your cards and draw new ones. This is your chance to improve your hand. If you have a pair, discard the other three cards. If you are close to a Straight or a Flush, discard the one card that doesn't fit.
3.  **[KO]** **Betting Strategy:** Don't be afraid to "Fold" if you have a very weak hand and the bets are getting high. Sometimes, you can "Bluff" by betting aggressively with a weak hand to try and scare your opponents into folding.
4.  **[KO]** **Reading Your Opponents:** Pay attention to how your opponents are betting. If an opponent makes a very large bet, they likely have a strong hand (or are bluffing!). If they just "Check" (bet nothing), their hand might be weak.

### Controls Guide

The game is played with on-screen buttons.

*   **[KO]** **Bet/Raise:** Increase the current bet.
*   **[KO]** **Check:** Bet nothing, passing the action to the next player (only possible if no one has bet before you in the round).
*   **[KO]** **Call:** Match the current bet to stay in the hand.
*   **[KO]** **Fold:** Give up the hand, forfeiting any money already in the pot.
*   **[KO]** **Discard:** During the draw phase, click on the cards you want to get rid of, then click the "Draw" button.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

*   **[KO]** **Q: What is the best hand in poker?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** A Royal Flush (A, K, Q, J, 10, all of the same suit) is the highest possible hand.

*   **[KO]** **Q: What does it mean to "bluff"?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** Bluffing is a key part of poker. It means you are pretending to have a strong hand by betting aggressively, hoping that your opponents will believe you and fold their (potentially better) hands.

*   **[KO]** **Q: When should I fold?**
    *   **[KO]** **A:** You should fold when you have a very weak hand (e.g., no pairs and no chance of a straight or flush) and another player has made a large bet. It's better to lose the small amount you've already bet than to risk losing much more on a bad hand.
