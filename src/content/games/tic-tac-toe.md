### Game Introduction

"Tic-Tac-Toe" is the classic strategy game where two players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to get three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. While the rules are simple, the game contains rich strategic thinking.

### Gameplay Strategy

1.  **Occupy Center**: If possible, prioritize taking the center position, which provides the most winning opportunities.
2.  **Block Opponents**: Always watch if opponents are about to win and block their three-in-a-row attempts.
3.  **Create Threats**: Try to create multiple winning threats simultaneously so opponents can't block them all.
4.  **Corner Priority**: After the center is taken, corner positions are more advantageous than edge positions.
5.  **First-Move Advantage**: As the first player, be aggressive; as the second player, focus on defense.

### How to Play

*   **Select Position**: Click on empty squares in the 3x3 grid to place your symbol.
*   **Take Turns**: Alternate moves with AI or other players.
*   **Observe Situation**: Carefully observe the current board state, looking for winning or blocking opportunities.
