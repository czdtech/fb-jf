### Detailed Game Introduction

Get 10 Ultimate is a simple yet deeply strategic number puzzle game. The board is filled with numbered tiles, and your goal is to combine them to create higher numbers. You do this by tapping on a group of two or more adjacent, identical numbers. This merges the entire group into a single new tile with a value that is one higher. The initial challenge is to reach the number 10, but the ultimate goal is to continue merging for as long as possible to achieve the highest number and score.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  **Think Before You Tap:** Every tap changes the layout of the board. Before you merge a group, consider how the tiles above will fall and what new groups might form. A good move can set up an even better move.
2.  **Create Large Groups:** While you can merge a group of just two tiles, it's much more efficient to create and merge larger groups. Try to maneuver tiles so that you have big clusters of the same number next to each other before you tap.
3.  **Don't Isolate High Numbers:** Be careful not to create a single high number that is surrounded by many different, lower numbers. This can make it very difficult to create another high number to merge it with, effectively blocking a large part of your board.
4.  **Work from the Bottom:** Making matches near the bottom of the board will cause the most tiles to shift, increasing the chances of creating new, unplanned matches as tiles fall into place.
