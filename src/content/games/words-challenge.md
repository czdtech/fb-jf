### Detailed Game Introduction

Words Challenge mixes anagram solving, mini crosswords, and quick prompts. Success favors pattern recognition (prefix/suffix), letter frequency intuition, and calm elimination under light timers.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

2.  Frequency: Lean on ETAOIN SHRDLU letter order for guesses.
3.  Cross logic: In crosswords, fill easy crossings to unlock tough slots.
4.  Don’t tunnel: Switch modes when stuck; momentum matters.
5.  Streaks: Maintain steady pace to keep multipliers.

### Controls Guide

- Drag letters for anagrams; type for crosswords; click options for prompts.
