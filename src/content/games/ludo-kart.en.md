### Detailed Game Introduction

Ludo Kart adapts classic Ludo into a quick, family‑friendly race. Roll dice to move tokens around the board, enter the final lane, and bring all tokens home before opponents do. Safe squares, captures, and lucky rolls create swings.

### Gameplay Strategy & Walkthrough

1.  Token spread: Advance multiple tokens to reduce risk of a single capture wiping progress.
2.  Safe spots: Park on safe squares when opponents are near.
3.  Entry timing: Time your entry to the home lane so opponents can’t immediately capture you.
4.  Counting ahead: Always check opponent threats within a dice range.
5.  Don’t tunnel: If a lead token is blocked, switch to another to keep pressure.

### Controls Guide

- Roll: Click/tap to roll the die.
- Move: Select a legal token to advance.
- Modes: Local multiplayer is common; solo vs. AI may be available.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- Is it pure luck? Dice matter, but token spread, safe‑square usage, and counting threats add strategy.
- Can I block? Occupying certain squares can block lanes; observe mode rules.
- How many players? Often 2–4; check mode options.
