### Game Introduction

Soccer Random is a chaotic and hilarious physics-based soccer game with a minimalist one-button control scheme. The objective is simple: score five goals before your opponent. The "random" part of the title comes from the fact that everything, from the type of ball and the player characters to the playing field itself, can change after every goal, forcing you to constantly adapt.

### Gameplay Guide

The first player or team to score 5 goals wins the match. All you can do is make your two players jump and kick at the same time. The challenge comes from the wacky physics and the unpredictable nature of the game. You might be playing on an icy field one moment and a beach the next. Use the single button to time your jumps perfectly to both attack the ball and defend your goal.

### Controls Guide

The game is designed for simplicity and can be played by one or two players on the same keyboard.
- **Player 1:** `W` Key
- **Player 2:** `Up Arrow` Key

Press your key to make your players jump and kick.
