# Archived Docs

These documents are kept for historical reference and should not be treated as
current guidance for development or refactoring. Prefer docs/CI-CD.md and
docs/DEPLOY-FAQ.md for active operational guidance.

- CLAUDE.md: Past refactor playbook oriented to a different agent.
- CLAUDE.md.bak-utf8-issue: Old backup copy (encoding issue).
- linus.md: Persona/process notes; superseded by current refactor plan.
